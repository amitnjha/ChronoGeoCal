Convert Marquesas Islands time to UTC:\n   Marquesas Islands time is -9 hours behind UTC, so 2025-12-05 12:00 -0930 is equivalent to 2025-12-05 21:00 UTC.\n\n2.

Calculate the time difference:\n   The difference between 2025-12-05 21:00 UTC and 2025-12-05 16:30 UTC is approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n4. Convert the time difference back to Lucknow time:\n   Since Lucknow is +5.5 hours ahead of UTC, the time difference of 4 hours and 30 minutes in UTC is equivalent to approximately 19 hours and 30 minutes in Lucknow time.\n\n5. Find the actual time in Lucknow when the event starts:\n   If the event starts at 2025-12-05 12:00 -0930 in Marquesas Islands time, then it starts at approximately 2025-12-04 03:30 in Lucknow time.",

Convert 2025-12-06 03:30 +0700 to UTC:\n   No adjustment is needed since +0700 is already in UTC.\n   So, 2025-12-06 03:30 +0700 is equivalent to 2025-12-06 03:30 UTC.\n\nNow, let's find the time difference:\n\n- Subtract the start time (2025-12-05 21:30 UTC) from the end time (2025-12-06 03:30 UTC).\n- The difference is approximately 14 hours and 0 minutes.\n\nSo, the event starts at approximately 2025-12-04 19:30 UTC in Novosibirsk. To convert this back to Novosibirsk's local time (which is +0700), we add 7 hours:\n\n- 7 hours = 7 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes\n- 30 minutes = 30 minutes\n\nSo, the event starts at approximately 2025-12-04 20:00 +0700 in Novosibirsk.",
