After 2 hours, it would be 09:00 in Ushuaia. Then, moving to Anadyr, it would be 18:00 the previous day (since there's a difference of 11 hours from Ushuaya to Anadyr). After 2 hours, it would be 20:00 in Anadyr.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the start and end times of the first meeting in Anadyr in DST, we need to consider that DST has already started in Fort Chipewyan. In this case, Fort Chipewyan would move its clock forward by 1 hour, making the start time of the first meeting in Anadyr 19:00. So, the answer is A for the start time and B for the end time.",
