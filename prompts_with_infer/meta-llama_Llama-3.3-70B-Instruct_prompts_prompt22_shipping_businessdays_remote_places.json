However, since the company's policy and the explanation provided seem to have led to confusion regarding when the counting of business days starts, let's clarify:\n\n- The order is placed on Thursday, a business day, before the cut-off time.\n- The next business day would be Sunday, as Thursday is the last business day of the week.\n\nCounting 3 business days from the next business day after Thursday (since the order is processed and shipped starting from the next business day, which is Sunday):\n1. Sunday, September 29\n2. Monday, September 30\n3. Tuesday, October 1\n\nTherefore, the package will arrive on 2024-10-01.",
