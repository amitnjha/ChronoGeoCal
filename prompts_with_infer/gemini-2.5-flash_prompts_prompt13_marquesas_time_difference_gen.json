This matches the actual start time in Pokhara Hamlets.\n\nThe premise states \"However, their calculation is incorrect.\" This implies that the \"1 hour\" mentioned by the speaker is incorrect in some context. The most likely interpretation, given the question about \"actual time difference,\" is that the speaker's statement implicitly misrepresents the general time zone difference between the two locations, or the overall time difference from the Marquesas event to the reference Pokhara Hamlets time.\n\nLet's calculate the overall time difference between the two time zones:\nMarquesas Islands Time (MRT) = UTC - 09:30\nNepal Standard Time (NPT) for Pokhara Hamlets = UTC + 05:45\nThe difference between NPT and MRT is (+05:45) - (-09:30) = 05:45 + 09:30 = 15 hours 15 minutes.\nSo, Pokhara Hamlets is 15 hours and 15 minutes ahead of Marquesas Islands. If the speaker was implying a general time difference of 1 hour between the locations, that would indeed be incorrect.\n\nThe actual time difference (between the two time zones) is **15 hours and 15 minutes**.\nWhen the event starts, it is actually **2025-12-06 03:15 +0545** in Pokhara Hamlets.",
