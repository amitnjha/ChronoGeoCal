Daylight saving time (DST) ends on the first Sunday of November in Canada, which in 2026 falls on November 1. However, since the question specifies the event happens on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, and assuming this date aligns closely with November 6 or 7, we proceed with November 6 as a potential date for the event, given DST ends before this date.\n\nGiven the flight departs at 2 AM (the time DST ends) and lasts for 6 hours, it would arrive at 8 AM local time in Fort Chipewyan. However, since the question asks for the time in Timbuktu, we must consider the time difference. Timbuktu is in the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) zone, and Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, is in the Mountain Standard Time (MST) zone, which is UTC-7. When DST ends, Fort Chipewyan would be UTC-7. Timbuktu, being on GMT (UTC+0), is 7 hours ahead of Fort Chipewyan.\n\nSo, if it's 8 AM in Fort Chipewyan (after falling back), it would be 3 PM in Timbuktu (8 AM + 7 hours).\n\nTo convert the arrival date and time back into the Hebrew calendar, considering the flight arrives on what would be November 6 in the Gregorian calendar, and given that the Hebrew calendar date provided (כ״א חשון) corresponds to around this time, the arrival would still be on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, but now in the afternoon.\n\nThus, the flight arrives at 3 PM local time in Timbuktu on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

The time difference is 8 hours.\n\nGiven the departure at 1:00 AM (after falling back) in Fort Chipewyan:\n- Convert to UTC: 1:00 AM MT = 8:00 AM UTC (since MT is UTC-7).\n- Add the 6-hour flight duration: 8:00 AM UTC + 6 hours = 2:00 PM UTC.\n- Convert to WAT (Bilma Oasis time): 2:00 PM UTC + 1 hour = 3:00 PM WAT.\n\nTo convert the arrival time back to the Hebrew calendar, knowing the flight arrives on November 7, 2026, and considering the Hebrew calendar date given as כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, and that the flight duration and time zone difference do not change the date:\n\nArrival Time in Local Time: 3:00 PM WAT on November 7, 2026.\nHebrew Calendar Date: Since the flight departs and arrives on the same Gregorian date, and given the initial departure date was כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, the arrival date remains כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

However, for the sake of calculation, let's proceed with the understanding that the time change is relevant.\n\nFort Chipewyan, AB, is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7) and observes DST, becoming UTC-6 during DST. When DST ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour, so the local time would change from UTC-6 to UTC-7.\n\nGhat, Libya, is in the Central European Time Zone (UTC+1).\n\nGiven the flight departs exactly when DST ends, let's assume the departure time in Fort Chipewyan is 2:00 AM (UTC-6) before the time change, which becomes 1:00 AM (UTC-7) after the clocks fall back.\n\nNow, calculate the arrival time in Ghat:\n- Departure Time (Fort Chipewyan, after DST ends): 1:00 AM UTC-7\n- Convert to UTC: 1:00 AM UTC-7 = 8:00 AM UTC\n- Convert to Ghat Time (UTC+1): 8:00 AM UTC = 9:00 AM UTC+1\n\nSo, the flight arrives at 9:00 AM local time in Ghat.\n\nTo convert this back to the Hebrew calendar for the arrival date:\n- The flight departs on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.\n- Given the 6-hour flight duration and the time difference, the arrival would still be on the same Hebrew calendar date, as the time difference and flight duration do not span more than 24 hours from the departure date.\n\nTherefore, the arrival time in Ghat is 9:00 AM local time on the same Hebrew calendar date, כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

The Hebrew year 5787 corresponds to the Gregorian years 2026-2027. Cheshvan 21, 5787, falls in November 2026.\n\nDaylight saving time ends on the first Sunday of November, which in 2026 is November 1. However, since Cheshvan 21 can vary, we need to calculate it precisely. Cheshvan 21, 5787, is approximately November 7, 2026.\n\nWhen daylight saving time ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour. So, if it's 2:00 AM, it becomes 1:00 AM.\n\nAssuming the flight departs exactly at 2:00 AM local time (when the time change occurs), it effectively departs at 1:00 AM after the clocks fall back.\n\nNow, considering the flight duration of 6 hours:\n- Departure (after falling back): 1:00 AM\n- Arrival: 1:00 AM + 6 hours = 7:00 AM local time.\n\nSkeleton Coast is in Namibia, which is in the Central African Time (CAT) zone, UTC+2. Fort Chipewyan, AB, Canada, is in the Mountain Standard Time (MST) zone, UTC-7. The time difference is 9 hours.\n\nIf it's 7:00 AM in Fort Chipewyan (after DST ends, so MST), we need to adjust for the time difference to find the time in Skeleton Coast:\n- 7:00 AM MST = 7:00 AM - 7 hours (to UTC) = 12:00 PM (noon) UTC\n- Then, to CAT (UTC+2): 12:00 PM (noon) + 2 hours = 2:00 PM CAT\n\nSo, the flight arrives at 2:00 PM local time in Skeleton Coast.\n\nTo convert this back to the Hebrew calendar for the arrival date:\n- The flight departs on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז (21 Cheshvan 5787).\n- Given the time difference and flight duration, it arrives on the same Hebrew date, as the travel time and time zones do not advance the date.\n\nTherefore, the arrival time in both local time and Hebrew calendar date at the destination is:\n2:00 PM, כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

        "response": "To solve this, we first need to establish the time change and then calculate the arrival time in the destination's local time, considering any potential time zone differences between Fort Chipewyan, AB, Canada, and Araouane, Mali.\n\n1. **Fort Chipewyan Time Zone**: Fort Chipewyan is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7) but observes daylight saving time, which would normally be UTC-6. However, on the date given (כ״א חשון תשפ״ז), daylight saving time ends, so it reverts to UTC-7.\n\n2. **Araouane Time Zone**: Araouane, Mali is in the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) zone, which is UTC+0.\n\n3. **Time Difference**: When Fort Chipewyan is on UTC-7 (after falling back), the time difference between Fort Chipewyan and Araouane would be 7 hours (since Araouane is at UTC+0).\n\nGiven the flight departs exactly when daylight saving time ends (let's say at 2:00 AM local time, as the specific time isn't provided but typically DST ends at 2:00 AM), and considering the time change:\n\n- **Departure Time in Fort Chipewyan**: 2:00 AM (after falling back)\n- **Time in Araouane at Departure**: 2:00 AM - 7 hours = 7:00 PM (previous day in Araouane)\n\nThe flight duration is 6 hours. Adding this to the departure time in Araouane's time frame:\n\n- **Arrival Time in Araouane**: 7:00 PM + 6 hours = 1:00 AM (next day in Araouane)\n\nTo convert this back to the Hebrew calendar date, we must know the exact Gregorian date of כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, which typically requires a conversion tool or table. However, without performing the exact conversion here, we can say the arrival time in local time is 1:00 AM the next day in Araouane. For the Hebrew calendar date, one would need to convert the Gregorian date of arrival (which would be the day after the DST change in Fort Chipewyan) back into the Hebrew calendar.",

The Hebrew year 5787 corresponds to the Gregorian years 2026/2027. כ״א חשון typically falls in November.\n\nAssuming כ״א חשון תשפ״ז is November 7, 2026, and considering DST ends on the first Sunday of November in Canada, which would be November 1, 2026, the clocks would have already fallen back. However, for the sake of calculation, let's proceed with the understanding that the time change is relevant.\n\nFort Chipewyan, AB, is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7) and observes DST, becoming UTC-6 during DST. When DST ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour, so the local time would change from UTC-6 to UTC-7.\n\nManang, Nepal, is in the Nepal Time Zone (UTC+5:45).\n\nThe time difference between Fort Chipewyan (UTC-7) and Manang (UTC+5:45) is 12 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nIf the flight departs exactly when DST ends, and assuming this is at 2:00 AM local time (the typical time for DST changes), the local time in Fort Chipewyan would change to 1:00 AM (as clocks fall back).\n\nDeparture Time (Fort Chipewyan): 1:00 AM (after falling back)\nFlight Duration: 6 hours\nArrival Time (Fort Chipewyan Time): 7:00 AM\n\nTo find the arrival time in Manang:\n- Add 12 hours and 45 minutes to the arrival time in Fort Chipewyan.\n\n7:00 AM + 12 hours = 7:00 PM\n7:00 PM + 45 minutes = 7:45 PM\n\nSo, the flight arrives at 7:45 PM local time in Manang.\n\nTo convert this back to the Hebrew calendar date, considering the significant time difference and assuming the flight departs on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, it arrives on כ״ב חשון תשפ״ז, given the crossing of the international date line is not a factor here but the significant time difference is.\n\nArrival Time in Manang: 7:45 PM on כ״ב חשון תשפ״ז.",

However, without the exact year conversion (תשפ״ז to a Gregorian year), we can't accurately determine the date. Assuming תשפ״ז corresponds to a year when כ״א חשון falls on the day DST ends in Fort Chipewyan, AB, which typically ends on the first Sunday of November.\n\nIf we consider the standard time zone for Fort Chipewyan, AB (Mountain Standard Time, MST, which is UTC-7), and assuming Anuta (likely referring to a small atoll in the Pacific, part of the Cook Islands, which is in the CKT time zone, UTC-10), there's a 3-hour difference when both are on standard time.\n\nGiven the lack of specific details on the year and the exact time of departure (only the date), let's assume a generic approach:\n\n1. **Departure Time Adjustment**: When clocks fall back, the local time essentially repeats an hour. So, if it was 1:59 AM and then DST ended, making it 1:00 AM again, a flight departing at this \"new\" 1:00 AM would actually depart at what was previously considered 2:00 AM (before the fall back).\n\n2. **Flight Duration and Time Zone Difference**: The flight is 6 hours long. If departing at 1:00 AM (after the fall back) from Fort Chipewyan, considering the time difference (MST to CKT is 3 hours behind), the arrival time without considering DST would be:\n   - 1:00 AM MST + 6 hours = 7:00 AM MST\n   - Convert to CKT: 7:00 AM MST - 3 hours = 4:00 AM CKT\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with a DST transition and the question lacks specificity on how Anuta observes time or if it observes DST (which is unlikely given its location), we'll proceed with the assumption that the primary concern is the calculation of time based on the provided information.\n\nGiven the information and the need for a precise calculation:\n- **Local Time Arrival**: 4:00 AM (CKT, assuming no DST observed in Anuta and accounting for the 3-hour difference).\n\nFor the **Hebrew Calendar Date** at arrival, since the flight duration is 6 hours and assuming the departure was on כ״א חשון, the arrival would still be on כ״א חשון, as the flight duration does not span across days in the Hebrew calendar context provided.\n\nThus, the arrival time in both local time and Hebrew calendar date at the destination would be:\n4:00 AM on כ״א חשון.",

The Hebrew year 5787 corresponds to the Gregorian years 2026-2027. Cheshvan 21, 5787, falls in November 2026.\n\nDaylight saving time ends on the first Sunday of November, which in 2026 is November 1.

        "response": "To solve this, we first need to establish the time change and then calculate the arrival time.\n\nGiven:\n- Departure time: כ״א חשון תשפ״ז (21 Cheshvan 5787), when daylight saving time ends.\n- Flight duration: 6 hours.\n- Destination: Lisala.\n\nFirst, convert the Hebrew date to a Gregorian date to understand the time change better. The Hebrew year 5787 corresponds to the Gregorian years 2026-2027. Cheshvan 21, 5787, falls in November 2026.\n\nDaylight saving time ends on the first Sunday of November, which in 2026 is November 1. However, since Cheshvan 21 can vary, we need to calculate it precisely. Cheshvan 21, 5787, is approximately November 7, 2026.\n\nWhen daylight saving time ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour. So, if it's 2:00 AM, it becomes 1:00 AM.\n\nAssuming the flight departs exactly at 2:00 AM local time (before the time change) in Fort Chipewyan, AB, which is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-6, and UTC-7 during standard time), and considering the time change:\n\n1. The time falls back to 1:00 AM (Mountain Standard Time, MST).\n2. The flight duration is 6 hours.\n\nFort Chipewyan, AB, to Lisala, Democratic Republic of the Congo, involves a significant time zone change. Lisala is in the West Africa Time (WAT) zone, which is UTC+1. The time difference between MST (UTC-7) and WAT (UTC+1) is 8 hours.\n\nSo, if the flight departs at 1:00 AM MST (after the time change):\n- Convert to UTC: 1:00 AM MST = 8:00 AM UTC (since MST is UTC-7).\n- Then to WAT (UTC+1): 8:00 AM UTC = 9:00 AM WAT.\n\nAdding the 6-hour flight duration:\n- 9:00 AM WAT + 6 hours = 3:00 PM WAT.\n\nTo convert this back to the Hebrew calendar for the arrival date:\n- The flight departs on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.\n- Given the time difference and flight duration, it arrives on the same Hebrew date, as the travel time and time zone difference do not advance the date.\n\nTherefore, the arrival time in local time is 3:00 PM, and in the Hebrew calendar, it remains כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

The Hebrew year 5787 corresponds to the Gregorian years 2026-2027.

In 2026, this date falls on November 7, 2026. \n\nDaylight saving time ends on the first Sunday of November, which in 2026 is November 1. However, since the question specifies November 7, and given that Fort Chipewyan, AB, observes daylight saving time, on November 7, clocks have already fallen back.\n\nThe flight departs at the exact time daylight saving time ends, which would be 2:00 AM local time (since clocks fall back from 2:00 AM to 1:00 AM). However, given the context, it seems the question intends for the departure to be at the moment clocks change, but since the change already occurred on November 1, the departure is simply at 1:00 AM local time on November 7.\n\nMandeville is assumed to be in Louisiana, which is in the Central Time Zone (CT). Fort Chipewyan, AB, is in the Mountain Time Zone (MT). On November 7, both zones are on standard time, with MT being UTC-7 and CT being UTC-6, making CT 1 hour ahead of MT.\n\nSo, if the flight departs at 1:00 AM MT, it departs at 2:00 AM CT.\n\nThe flight duration is 6 hours, so it arrives at 8:00 AM CT.\n\nIn the Hebrew calendar, since the departure and arrival occur on the same day in the Gregorian calendar, and given that the Hebrew date was provided for the departure (כ״א חשון תשפ״ז), the arrival date remains the same.\n\nThus, the flight arrives at 8:00 AM local time on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

The Hebrew date כ״א חשון תשפ״ז corresponds to November 6, 2026, in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nFort Chipewyan, AB, is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7) and observes daylight saving time, which ends on the first Sunday of November. When daylight saving time ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour, moving from Mountain Daylight Time (UTC-6) to Mountain Standard Time (UTC-7).\n\nBursa, Turkey, is in the Eastern European Time Zone (UTC+2) during standard time and Eastern European Summer Time (UTC+3) during daylight saving time. However, Turkey does not observe daylight saving time in the same manner as North America or Europe; it typically follows UTC+3 year-round.\n\nAssuming the flight departs at 2:00 AM local time (the moment daylight saving time ends, and clocks fall back), the local time becomes 1:00 AM Mountain Standard Time (UTC-7).\n\nNow, calculate the arrival time in Bursa:\n- Departure Time (Mountain Standard Time): 1:00 AM\n- Flight Duration: 6 hours\n- Arrival Time (Mountain Standard Time): 7:00 AM\n- Time Difference (Bursa is UTC+3, and Fort Chipewyan is UTC-7): 10 hours ahead\n- Arrival Time in Bursa (UTC+3): 7:00 AM + 10 hours = 5:00 PM\n\nConvert the arrival date and time to the Hebrew calendar:\n- November 6, 2026, corresponds to כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.\n- The flight arrives on the same day, given the time zones and flight duration.\n\nTherefore, the flight arrives at 5:00 PM local time in Bursa on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

        "response": "To solve this, first convert כ״א חשון תשפ״ז to the Gregorian calendar. תשפ״ז corresponds to 2026-2027. כ״א חשון would be around November 6 or 7, 2026, considering the Hebrew calendar's variability. \n\nDaylight saving time (DST) ends on the first Sunday of November in Canada, which in 2026 falls on November 1. However, since the question specifies כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, and assuming this date aligns closer to November 6 or 7, we proceed with November 7, 2026, as the reference date for DST change, keeping in mind the actual DST change occurs on November 1.\n\nGiven the flight departs at the exact time DST ends (2 AM, as DST typically ends at 2 AM), and considering the time change, the new departure time after \"falling back\" would be 1 AM local time.\n\nThe flight duration is 6 hours to Kahramanmaras, Turkey. Turkey is 9 hours ahead of Fort Chipewyan, AB, during standard time (not considering DST differences since Turkey does not observe DST in the same manner).\n\nSo, if the flight departs at 1 AM local time in Fort Chipewyan:\n- In Fort Chipewyan time, it would arrive 6 hours later at 7 AM.\n- Converting to Kahramanmaras time: 7 AM (Fort Chipewyan) + 9 hours = 4 PM Kahramanmaras time.\n\nTo convert the arrival date to the Hebrew calendar, considering the flight arrives on November 7, 2026, in the Gregorian calendar, and given that the Hebrew date provided for departure was כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, the arrival would still be within the month of חשון, as the flight duration does not span into the next Hebrew month.\n\nThus, the arrival time in Kahramanmaras would be 4 PM local time on a date that corresponds to כ״א or כ״ב חשון תשפ״ז, depending on the exact timing and accounting for the international date line and time zone differences.",

The Hebrew year 5787 corresponds to the Gregorian years 2026/2027. כ״א חשון typically falls in November.\n\nAssuming כ״א חשון תשפ״ז is November 7, 2026, and considering DST ends on the first Sunday of November in Canada, which would be November 1, 2026, the clocks would have already fallen back. However, for the sake of calculation, let's proceed with the understanding that the time change is relevant.\n\nFort Chipewyan, AB, is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7) and observes DST, becoming UTC-6 during DST. When DST ends, it reverts to UTC-7.\n\nTabuk, Saudi Arabia, is in the Arabian Standard Time (AST) zone, which is UTC+3.\n\nThe time difference between Fort Chipewyan (UTC-7) and Tabuk (UTC+3) is 10 hours.\n\nIf the flight departs at 2:00 AM local time (the moment DST ends, and clocks fall back, so it would actually be 1:00 AM in the new standard time, but for simplicity, we'll consider the departure in the context of the question as 2:00 AM, understanding the clock adjustment), and considering the flight duration and time zone difference:\n\nDeparture Time (Fort Chipewyan): 2:00 AM (in the new standard time, post-DST)\nFlight Duration: 6 hours\nArrival Time (Fort Chipewyan Time): 8:00 AM\n\nTo find the arrival time in Tabuk:\n- Add the 10-hour difference: 8:00 AM + 10 hours = 6:00 PM (Tabuk time)\n\nSo, the flight arrives at 6:00 PM local time in Tabuk.\n\nTo convert this back to the Hebrew calendar for the arrival date:\n- The flight departs on כ״א חשון.\n- Given the time difference and flight duration, it arrives on the same Hebrew calendar date, as the travel time and time zone adjustments do not advance the date.\n\nTherefore, the arrival time in both local time and Hebrew calendar date at the destination is:\n6:00 PM on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

Fort Chipewyan is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7), and when daylight saving time ends, it moves to standard time (UTC-7). Najran is in the Arabia Standard Time zone (UTC+3). The time difference is 10 hours.\n\nGiven that כ״א חשון תשפ״ז corresponds to a specific date in the Gregorian calendar, we first need to convert this date. However, without converting the Hebrew date to a Gregorian date, we can still calculate the time difference and arrival time based on the information given.\n\nIf the flight departs at the exact time daylight saving time ends (which would be 2 AM local time, as clocks fall back from 2 AM to 1 AM), and considering the flight duration is 6 hours, the arrival time in local time at the destination (Najran) would be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Convert departure time to UTC: Since Fort Chipewyan moves from UTC-6 (DST) to UTC-7 (standard time) at the moment of departure, and assuming the departure is at 1 AM local time (after the fall back), this would be 8 AM UTC (1 AM + 7 hours to convert to UTC).\n\n2. Calculate arrival time in UTC: Adding the 6-hour flight duration to the departure time in UTC gives us 2 PM UTC (8 AM + 6 hours).\n\n3. Convert arrival time to Najran local time: Since Najran is UTC+3, we add 3 hours to the arrival time in UTC, resulting in 5 PM local time in Najran.\n\nTo find the Hebrew calendar date at the destination, without the specific conversion of כ״א חשון תשפ״ז to the Gregorian calendar, we acknowledge that the flight's duration and the time difference do not change the date in the Hebrew calendar, as the travel time and time zone differences do not accumulate to a full day difference that would advance the date in the Hebrew calendar beyond the next day.\n\nThus, the arrival time in Najran would be 5 PM local time, and the Hebrew calendar date would remain the same, as the travel time does not advance into the next Hebrew calendar day.",

        "response": "To solve this, we first need to establish the time change and then calculate the arrival time in Zarqa, considering the time difference between Fort Chipewyan, AB, and Zarqa.\n\nFort Chipewyan, AB is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7), and when daylight saving time ends, it falls back to standard time (UTC-7). Zarqa, being in Jordan, is in the Eastern European Time Zone (UTC+2) during standard time and Eastern European Summer Time (UTC+3) during daylight saving time. However, since the question does not specify the daylight saving status in Zarqa at the time of the flight, we'll assume standard time for simplicity (UTC+2), as Jordan typically ends daylight saving time in October.\n\nThe time difference between Fort Chipewyan (UTC-7) and Zarqa (UTC+2) is 9 hours.\n\nGiven the flight departs on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, which corresponds to a specific date in the Gregorian calendar, we need to convert this date. However, without converting the Hebrew date to a Gregorian date, we can proceed with understanding that the flight duration is 6 hours.\n\nIf the flight departs at the exact time daylight saving time ends (let's say 2 AM local time, as the specific time isn't given but typically DST ends at 2 AM), and considering the time change:\n\n1. The local time in Fort Chipewyan falls back to 1 AM (UTC-7).\n2. The flight duration is 6 hours, so it arrives at 7 AM local time in Fort Chipewyan (1 AM + 6 hours).\n\nNow, converting this to Zarqa time (UTC+2), considering the 9-hour difference:\n\n7 AM (UTC-7) = 4 PM (UTC+2) in Zarqa.\n\nThus, the flight arrives at 4 PM local time in Zarqa. To find the Hebrew calendar date at the destination, since the flight duration is less than a day and assuming the departure was before sunset in Fort Chipewyan, the arrival date in the Hebrew calendar would still be כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

San Pedro de Atacama, Chile is in the Chile Standard Time Zone, which is UTC-3 for standard time and UTC-3 during their standard time as well, since Chile's DST schedule differs and typically starts in September and ends in March, but the exact dates can vary.\n\nGiven that כ״א חשון תשפ״ז corresponds to November 6, 2026, and assuming Anaktuvuk Pass falls back at 2 AM AKDT to 1 AM AKST on this date:\n\n1. The flight departs at 1 AM AKST (after the fall back).\n2. San Pedro de Atacama is 6 hours ahead of AKST (since AKST is UTC-9 and Chile Standard Time is UTC-3).\n3. The flight duration is 6 hours.\n\nSo, if the flight departs at 1 AM AKST, we add the 6-hour time difference to get the local time in San Pedro de Atacama, which would be 7 AM (1 AM + 6 hours).

The time difference between AKST and YAKT is 16 hours when AKST is in standard time.\n\nGiven that daylight saving time ends and clocks fall back one hour in Anaktuvuk Pass, we're considering the moment right after the fall back, so the time zone is AKST.\n\nThe Hebrew date כ״א חשון תשפ״ז translates to November 7, 2026, in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nAssuming the flight departs exactly at 2:00 AM AKDT (the moment DST ends and it becomes 1:00 AM AKST), and considering the 16-hour difference (since Verkhoyansk is 16 hours ahead of Anaktuvuk Pass during AKST), the local time in Verkhoyansk when it's 1:00 AM AKST would be 5:00 PM YAKT on the same day.\n\nAdding the 6-hour flight duration to the departure time (1:00 AM AKST), we get 7:00 AM AKST on November 8, 2026.\n\nConverting this to Verkhoyansk time (16 hours ahead), we get 11:00 PM YAKT on November 8, 2026.\n\nIn the Hebrew calendar, November 8, 2026, corresponds to כ״ז חשון תשפ״ז.\n\nTherefore, the flight arrives at 11:00 PM local time on כ״ז חשון תשפ״ז.",

Cheshvan 21, 5787, would approximately correspond to November 7, 2026.\n\n2. **Time Zones**: Anaktuvuk Pass, AK, observes Alaska Standard Time (AKST, UTC-9) after daylight saving ends. Ngari, being in the Tibet Time Zone (UTC+8), is 17 hours ahead of AKST.\n\n3. **Flight Departure and Duration**: If the flight departs exactly when daylight saving time ends (2 AM AKDT becomes 1 AM AKST), and the flight duration is 6 hours, the arrival time in AKST would be 7 AM.\n\n4. **Arrival Time in Ngari**: Adding the 17-hour difference to 7 AM AKST to get the time in Ngari (UTC+8), we get 12 AM (next day) in Ngari.\n\n5. **Hebrew Calendar Date at Destination**: Since Ngari is a day ahead due to the time zone difference, and considering the flight departs on what corresponds to November 7, 2026, in the Gregorian calendar, the arrival would be on what corresponds to November 8, 2026. In the Hebrew calendar, this would still be around Cheshvan 21 or possibly Cheshvan 22, 5787, depending on the exact conversion and time of year, but given the time difference, it would likely be Cheshvan 22, 5787.\n\n**Arrival Time in Local Time**: 12 AM (next day)\n**Hebrew Calendar Date**: Cheshvan 22, 5787",

However, since we're calculating the arrival time in local time at the destination and then converting it back to the Hebrew calendar date, we first need to establish the correct time difference and account for any DST in the destination, if applicable.\n\nMagadan Time (MAGT) is UTC+11, and AKST is UTC-9. The difference is 20 hours.\n\nSo, if it's 7 AM AKST:\n- Convert to UTC: 7 AM - 9 hours = 10 PM (previous day) UTC\n- Convert to MAGT: 10 PM + 11 hours = 9 AM (next day) MAGT\n\nThus, the arrival time in Okhotsk would be 9 AM local time.\n\nTo convert this back to the Hebrew calendar:\n- The flight departs on approximately November 7, 2026.\n- Given the significant time difference, the arrival would be on the next day in the Gregorian calendar, which would be November 8, 2026.\n\nConverting November 8, 2026, to the Hebrew calendar gives us approximately כ״ג חשון תשפ״ז.\n\nTherefore, the flight arrives at 9 AM local time on כ״ג חשון תשפ״ז.",

The time difference between AKST and CAT is 11 hours (when AK is on standard time).\n\nGiven that כ״א חשון תשפ״ז corresponds to a specific date in the Gregorian calendar, we need to convert it. However, without the exact conversion provided here, let's proceed conceptually:\n\n1. **Convert Hebrew Date to Gregorian Date**: The Hebrew date כ״א חשון תשפ״ז needs to be converted to a Gregorian date. For simplicity, let's assume this step is done, and we know the date in November (since Cheshvan usually falls in October/November).\n\n2. **Daylight Saving Time (DST) Adjustment**: When DST ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour. If the flight departs at this exact moment, we consider the time before and after the change. Let's say the departure time is 2:00 AM AKDT. After the DST change, it becomes 1:00 AM AKST.\n\n3. **Calculate Arrival Time**: \n    - **Flight Duration**: 6 hours.\n    - **Time Difference**: AKST to CAT is 11 hours ahead.\n    \n    If the flight departs at 1:00 AM AKST, we add the flight duration and then the time difference:\n    - 1:00 AM + 6 hours = 7:00 AM AKST\n    - Then, add the 11-hour difference to CAT: 7:00 AM + 11 hours = 6:00 PM CAT\n\n4. **Hebrew Calendar Date at Destination**: Since the flight duration is 6 hours and the time difference is 11 hours, the date could potentially change depending on the starting date and time. However, given the time difference and assuming the flight departs early in the morning AKST, it's possible the date remains the same in the Hebrew calendar at the destination, but this depends on the exact starting date and time.\n\nWithout the exact starting date in the Gregorian calendar, we can't accurately provide the Hebrew date at the destination.

However, since the question specifies the event happens on כ״א חשון, and assuming this is around November 7, we proceed with the understanding that DST has already ended in Anaktuvuk Pass, AK.\n\nAnaktuvuk Pass, AK is in the Alaska Time Zone (AKST). When DST ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour to standard time. However, since Alaska does not observe DST in the same manner as the rest of the U.S. (except for some areas), and considering the remote location, the specifics of DST observation might be nuanced. For simplicity, let's assume the time change is relevant for calculation purposes as per the question's intent.\n\nIf the flight departs at 2 AM AKST (when DST ends, and assuming this is the time it \"falls back\"), it would actually be 1 AM AKST after the clocks adjust back. However, since the question implies the departure is exactly at the moment of time change, and without specific times given, let's consider a generic approach:\n\nDeparture Time (after falling back): 1 AM AKST (November 7, 2026)\nFlight Duration: 6 hours\n\nArrival Time in AKST: 7 AM AKST\n\nNow, to convert this to Arthur's Town time (EST), considering AKST is 4 hours behind EST:\n- 7 AM AKST = 11 AM EST\n\nHebrew Calendar Date at Destination:\nSince the flight duration is 6 hours and crosses into a new day in the EST zone, but not necessarily in the Hebrew calendar date (as the date change occurs at sunset), the arrival date in the Hebrew calendar would still be כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, assuming the flight arrives before sunset.\n\nArrival Time in Local Time and Hebrew Calendar Date:\n11 AM EST, כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

Port-de-Paix, Haiti is in the Eastern Standard Time Zone (EST) without daylight saving, which is UTC-5.\n\nThe time difference between AKST and EST is 4 hours.\n\nGiven that כ״א חשון תשפ״ז corresponds to November 6, 2026, and assuming the flight departs exactly when daylight saving time ends (2 AM AKDT becomes 1 AM AKST), we calculate the arrival time as follows:\n\n1. Convert 1 AM AKST to EST: 1 AM AKST + 4 hours = 5 AM EST.\n2. Add the flight duration: 5 AM EST + 6 hours = 11 AM EST.\n\nTherefore, the flight arrives at 11 AM local time in Port-de-Paix.\n\nTo convert this back to the Hebrew calendar date, since the flight departs on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז (November 6, 2026) and arrives after a 6-hour flight, the date remains the same because the flight duration does not span into the next Hebrew calendar day, considering the time zones involved.\n\nSo, the arrival time in both local time and Hebrew calendar date is 11 AM on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

The time difference between AKST and AST is 4 hours (when AK is on standard time).\n\nGiven that daylight saving time ends and clocks fall back one hour in Anaktuvuk Pass, this means the time zone temporarily aligns with AKST (instead of AKDT) at the moment of the fall back.\n\nThe Hebrew date כ״א חשון תשפ״ז needs to be converted to a Gregorian date to understand the time zones and DST rules better. However, without performing the conversion here, we know that in November (which חשון typically falls into), the US observes the end of DST, which usually happens on the first Sunday of November.\n\nAssuming the flight departs exactly when DST ends (and thus clocks fall back), and considering the time zones:\n\n1. **Starting Time and Date Conversion**: The exact Gregorian date for כ״א חשון תשפ״ז is needed for precise calculation, but given the context, let's assume it's around early November.\n2. **Time Zones**: Anaktuvuk Pass falls back to AKST (UTC-9), and San Pedro de Macorís is on AST (UTC-4).\n3. **Flight Duration**: 6 hours.\n\nGiven these assumptions and without the exact starting time, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where the flight departs at 2:00 AM AKDT (just before the fall back) on the day DST ends. After falling back, it becomes 1:00 AM AKST.\n\n- **Departure Time in AKST**: 1:00 AM\n- **Time Difference to AST**: AKST is UTC-9, and AST is UTC-4, so AST is 5 hours ahead of AKST.\n- **Arrival Time in AST**: 1:00 AM AKST + 5 hours = 6:00 AM AST + 6 hours flight duration = 12:00 PM AST\n\nWithout the exact Hebrew date conversion and assuming the above scenario for illustration, the arrival time in San Pedro de Macorís would be 12:00 PM local time. For the exact Hebrew calendar date at arrival, the conversion of the arrival date (Gregorian to Hebrew) would be necessary, considering the flight's duration and time zone differences.",

However, without this information, we can only provide the arrival time in AKST and the Hebrew calendar date.\n\nThe Hebrew calendar date remains the same since the flight duration does not cross into a new day in the Hebrew calendar (which typically begins at sunset).\n\nTherefore, the arrival time in local time at the destination cannot be precisely determined without the destination's time zone, but in AKST, it would be 7 AM.

However, since the question specifies November 7 as the date when DST ends and clocks fall back, there seems to be a discrepancy. For the purpose of calculation, let's proceed with the assumption that the clock falls back on this specific date for the sake of solving the problem as presented.\n\nAt the moment DST ends, clocks fall back from 2:00 AM to 1:00 AM (Alaska Standard Time, AKST, UTC-9).\n\nGiven the flight departs at this exact time (1:00 AM AKST), and considering the flight duration is 6 hours, the arrival time in AKST would be:\n- 1:00 AM + 6 hours = 7:00 AM AKST\n\nPointe-à-Pitre is in the Atlantic Standard Time zone (UTC-4), which is 5 hours ahead of AKST (UTC-9). So, we adjust the arrival time accordingly:\n- 7:00 AM AKST = 12:00 PM (noon) AST\n\nIn the Hebrew calendar, the date remains the same since the flight duration does not span across dates that would change the Hebrew date significantly given the initial conditions.\n\nTherefore, the flight arrives at 12:00 PM (noon) local time in Pointe-à-Pitre on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז‎.",

        "response": "To solve this, we first need to establish the time change and then calculate the arrival time in Sanliurfa, considering the time difference between Anaktuvuk Pass, AK, and Sanliurfa, Turkey.\n\nAnaktuvuk Pass, AK is in the Alaska Time Zone (AKST), and when daylight saving time ends, it falls back to standard time, which is UTC-9. Sanliurfa, Turkey is in the Eastern European Time Zone (EET), which is UTC+2, and also observes daylight saving time as Eastern European Summer Time (EEST), UTC+3. However, the question does not specify if Sanliurfa is on daylight saving time at the time of the flight, so we'll consider the standard time zone difference for simplicity.\n\nThe time difference between AKST (UTC-9) and EET (UTC+2) is 11 hours.\n\nGiven the flight departs at the exact time daylight saving time ends (let's say 2 AM AKDT, becoming 1 AM AKST), and the flight duration is 6 hours, the arrival time in AKST would be 7 AM AKST.\n\nConverting this to EET (adding 11 hours), we get 6 PM EET.\n\nThe Hebrew calendar date of כ״א חשון תשפ״ז corresponds to a specific date in the Gregorian calendar, but without calculating the exact date, we can say the arrival time in Sanliurfa would be 6 PM local time on the same Hebrew calendar date, considering the travel time does not cross into a new day in the Hebrew calendar, which typically begins at sunset. \n\nSo, the arrival time in both local time and Hebrew calendar date at the destination would be 6 PM on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

When DST ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour, but since Alaska doesn't observe DST in the same manner as the rest of the US (only a portion of Alaska observes DST), and considering the question's specifics might imply an adjustment, we'll consider the flight departing at the moment clocks change, which could be 2 AM AKDT becoming 1 AM AKST.\n\nThe flight duration is 6 hours to Kahramanmaras, Turkey. Kahramanmaras is in the Eastern European Time Zone (EET), which is 10 hours ahead of AKST.\n\nSo, if the flight departs at 1 AM AKST, we add 6 hours for the flight duration: 1 AM + 6 hours = 7 AM AKST.\n\nThen, convert to EET: 7 AM AKST + 10 hours = 5 PM EET.\n\nTo convert the arrival time back to the Hebrew calendar, the flight arrives on November 6, 2026, which corresponds to כ״א חשון תשפ״ז. \n\nThus, the flight arrives at 5 PM local time on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז in Kahramanmaras.",
