However, since we are only asked to provide an estimate, it's best to round the date to the nearest month. So, the start of Ramadan in 2022 would likely be in March or early April.)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual start date of Ramadan is determined by the sighting of the crescent moon, which can cause variations in the exact date.
