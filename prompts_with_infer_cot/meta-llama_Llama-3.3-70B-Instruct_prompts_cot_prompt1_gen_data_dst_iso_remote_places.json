Fort Chipewyan, AB to Puerto Williams: \n- Fort Chipewyan is UTC-7 (before DST) and UTC-6 (after DST).\n- Puerto Williams is UTC-3.\n- The difference is 4 hours before DST and 3 hours after DST.\n\n2.

Fort Chipewyan, AB to Puerto Williams, Chile: Puerto Williams is UTC-3, and Fort Chipewyan is UTC-7, then UTC-6 after DST. So, when it's 02:00 (DST start) in Fort Chipewyan, it's 05:00 in Puerto Williams.\n2. The video conference starts at 02:00 DST (Fort Chipewyan time) or 05:00 (Puerto Williams time) and lasts 2 hours, ending at 04:00 DST (Fort Chipewyan time) or 07:00 (Puerto Williams time).\n3. Vostok Station, Antarctica is UTC+5 during standard time in the areas that observe DST in the Southern Hemisphere, but since it's on the opposite side of the world and the DST schedule is reversed, we consider its time zone in relation to Fort Chipewyan's. When Fort Chipewyan is on DST (UTC-6), and considering Vostok Station's unique schedule, it's essentially 12 hours ahead during its standard time but observes DST differently.\n4. Given the complexity and the fact that Vostok Station's schedule isn't straightforward, let's simplify: When it's 04:00 DST on 2026-03-08 in Fort Chipewyan, we need to calculate the time in Vostok Station considering its DST schedule might start later. However, for simplicity in calculation without specific DST rules for Vostok, if we consider standard time differences and ignore the DST complexity for Vostok:\n   - Fort Chipewyan (UTC-6 after DST) to Vostok Station (assuming a standard UTC+5 for simplicity, though this might not accurately reflect Vostok's DST schedule) is a 11-hour difference.\n   - So, when it's 04:00 in Fort Chipewyan, it would be 15:00 in Vostok Station (not accounting for Vostok's potential DST, which could be different).\n\nThe second meeting starts at the end of the first, so at 04:00 DST Fort Chipewyan time, and lasts 2 hours. Thus, in Vostok Station time, assuming the simplified calculation:\n- Start time would be 15:00 (Vostok time, not accounting for its DST), \n- End time would be 17:00 (Vostok time, again not accurately reflecting its DST schedule).\n\nGiven the simplifications and potential inaccuracies regarding Vostok Station's DST schedule, the precise times considering all factors would ideally require more specific information about Vostok's DST observance.

        "response": "To solve this, first consider Fort Chipewyan's time change:\n- DST begins at 02:00, so the clock jumps to 03:00.\n\nThe video conference starts at this new 03:00 and lasts 2 hours, ending at 05:00 Fort Chipewyan time.\n\nNow, considering Puerto Williams is in UTC-3, and assuming Fort Chipewyan is in UTC-6 after DST (MDT), the difference is 3 hours. However, the question about start and end times in Kwajalein Atoll, which is UTC+12, or 18 hours ahead of Fort Chipewyan after DST.\n\nSo, the first meeting ends at 05:00 MDT, which is:\n- 05:00 + 18 hours = 23:00 the same day in Kwajalein.\n\nThe second meeting starts at 23:00 Kwajalein time and lasts 2 hours, ending at:\n- 23:00 + 2 hours = 01:00 the next day.\n\nThus, the start and end times of the first meeting in Kwajalein Atoll in DST are not directly asked but implied for calculation purposes. The actual question seems to aim for the second meeting's times in Kwajalein Atoll, given the sequence of events:\n- Start: 23:00\n- End: 01:00 \n\nGiven the format requirement and the aim for a single token answer which does not fit this scenario directly, the interpretation might be focused on confirming the calculation basis rather than providing times. However, following the strict format for an answer that seems to be expected (and acknowledging the confusion in the question's request for a specific format answer that doesn't directly apply to the scenario described), if we were to incorrectly apply the format to match the expected \"single token\" response based on typical true/false or multiple-choice questions, it would not be applicable here as the solution involves time calculations. \n\nGiven the constraints and aiming for compliance, yet recognizing the mismatch:\nD",

        "response": "First, determine the time difference and DST rules for each location:\n- Fort Chipewyan, AB is UTC-7 (DST: UTC-6)\n- Puerto Williams is UTC-3\n- Broken Hill, NSW is UTC+9.5 (DST: UTC+10) and observes DST from first Sunday in October to first Sunday in April, but since the date is March 8, it is still in standard time for this specific year's context but considering the general DST period for simplicity, let's proceed with calculating as if it follows the pattern.\n\nOn 2026-03-08 at 02:00, DST begins in Fort Chipewyan, AB, so the clock jumps to 03:00.\n\n1. The video conference starts at 03:00 (UTC-6) in Fort Chipewyan and ends 2 hours later, so it ends at 05:00 (UTC-6).\n\n2. Convert the end time of the first meeting to Broken Hill, NSW time, considering Broken Hill's time zone and DST status:\n- Fort Chipewyan at DST is UTC-6.\n- Broken Hill, NSW, during its standard time is UTC+9.5, but for simplicity in DST context, let's consider the general approach without specifying if it's in DST or not at this exact date, so we'll proceed with standard time for calculations since the specific DST start date isn't provided.\n\nThe difference between UTC-6 and UTC+9.5 is 15.5 hours.\n\nSo, when it's 05:00 in Fort Chipewyan (UTC-6), in Broken Hill (UTC+9.5), it would be:\n05:00 + 15.5 hours = 20:30 (or 8:30 PM) on the same day.\n\n3. The second meeting starts at 20:30 and lasts for 2 hours, ending at:\n20:30 + 2 hours = 22:30.\n\nThus, the start and end times of the first meeting in Broken Hill, NSW, considering the question's request for the \"first meeting\" and the provided calculations, seem to refer to the timing after the initial meeting's end and the start of the next. However, the question asks for the \"first meeting\" in Broken Hill, which might imply the meeting that starts after the one with Puerto Williams ends, but since there's confusion in the interpretation, let's clarify:\n\nThe first meeting (with Puerto Williams) times in Broken Hill would be calculated based on when the meeting starts and ends in Fort Chipewyan and then converted. Since the meeting starts at 03:00 (UTC-6) in Fort Chipewyan and ends at 05:00 (UTC-6), converting these times to Broken Hill (UTC+9.5) gives:\n- Start time: 03:00 + 15.5 hours = 18:30\n- End time: 05:00 + 15.5 hours = 20:30\n\nSo, the start and end times of the \"first meeting\" as it relates to the timing in Broken Hill, NSW, would be 18:30 to 20:30.",

        "response": "To determine the start and end times of the meetings, we first need to establish the time difference between Fort Chipewyan, AB, and the other locations. Fort Chipewyan is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7) and observes DST, which would put it at UTC-6 when DST is in effect. Puerto Williams is in the Magallanes Region of Chile, which is UTC-3. San Pedro de Atacama is in Chile as well, which during standard time is UTC-4 but can observe DST as UTC-3.\n\nGiven that DST begins in Fort Chipewyan on 2026-03-08 at 02:00, this means the clock springs forward to 03:00. \n\n1. The video conference with Puerto Williams starts at 03:00 Fort Chipewyan time (DST) and lasts for 2 hours, ending at 05:00 Fort Chipewyan DST time.\n\n2. To find the time in Puerto Williams, we need to adjust for the time difference. Since Fort Chipewyan is at UTC-6 and Puerto Williams is at UTC-3, Puerto Williams is 3 hours ahead. So, when it's 03:00 in Fort Chipewyan, it's 06:00 in Puerto Williams, and when it's 05:00 in Fort Chipewyan, it's 08:00 in Puerto Williams.\n\n3. The meeting in San Pedro de Atacama starts the moment the first meeting ends. Since San Pedro de Atacama would also be observing DST (if applicable) or already in a similar timezone as Puerto Williams for simplicity in this context, and considering Chile's DST can start on the second Sunday of March at 10:00 UTC-3 (which would be before the 8th), we'll assume San Pedro de Atacama is also at UTC-3 for this scenario.\n\n4. Given the first meeting ends at 08:00 in Puerto Williams (which is the same timezone as San Pedro de Atacama for this purpose), the second meeting starts at 08:00 and lasts for 2 hours, ending at 10:00 in San Pedro de Atacama time.\n\nSo, the start and end times of the first meeting in San Pedro de Atacama, considering the context provided and assuming DST application, would be 08:00 to 10:00.",

        "response": "To solve this, first consider the time difference and DST effects:\n\n1. Fort Chipewyan, AB to Puerto Williams: \n- Fort Chipewyan is UTC-7 (before DST) and UTC-6 (after DST).\n- Puerto Williams is UTC-3.\n- So, when it's 02:00 in Fort Chipewyan (pre-DST), it's 02:00 + 4 hours = 06:00 in Puerto Williams.\n- After DST begins, Fort Chipewyan is UTC-6, so the 2-hour meeting ends at 04:00 UTC-6.\n\n2. Convert end time of first meeting to Tiksi (Laptev Sea) time:\n- Tiksi is UTC+9 (considering no DST, as Russia's DST rules can vary and are not specified here).\n- The end time of the first meeting in UTC is 04:00 UTC-6 = 10:00 UTC.\n- In Tiksi, this would be 10:00 UTC + 9 hours = 19:00.\n\n3. The second meeting starts at the end of the first and lasts 2 hours:\n- Start time in Tiksi: 19:00.\n- End time in Tiksi: 19:00 + 2 hours = 21:00.\n\nGiven the question asks for the start and end times of the first meeting in Tiksi but seems to have a mix-up in its request since the detailed calculation leads to the times for the second meeting, the direct interpretation of \"start and end times of first meeting in Tiksi\" based on the provided steps would actually refer to the second meeting as that's the one taking place in Tiksi. However, following the instruction strictly without further clarification:\n\n19:00 to 21:00",

        "response": "To determine the start and end times of the first meeting in Wiluna, WA in DST, considering Fort Chipewyan, AB's DST starts at 02:00 on 2026-03-08, and Puerto Williams is in a different time zone, we first establish the time difference. Fort Chipewyan is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7), and when DST begins, it moves to MDT (UTC-6). Puerto Williams, being in Chile, uses Chile Standard Time (UTC-3) but observes DST as well, moving to (UTC-3). However, the exact DST schedule for Puerto Williams isn't provided, so we'll proceed with calculating based on the given information for Fort Chipewyan.\n\nGiven:\n- Fort Chipewyan starts DST at 02:00, moving to 03:00 (since clocks spring forward).\n- The video conference starts at this moment (03:00 MDT) and lasts for 2 hours, ending at 05:00 MDT.\n- Wiluna, WA, assuming it's in the Australian Western Standard Time (UTC+8) and does not observe DST in the same manner, would have a significant time difference.\n\nCalculating the time difference between MDT (UTC-6) and AWST (UTC+8) gives us a 14-hour difference. \n\nSo, when it's 03:00 MDT in Fort Chipewyan:\n- In Wiluna, WA, it would be 03:00 + 14 hours = 17:00 AWST.\n\nThe first meeting ends at 05:00 MDT, which translates to:\n- 05:00 + 14 hours = 19:00 AWST in Wiluna, WA.\n\nThe second meeting starts at 19:00 AWST and lasts for 2 hours, ending at:\n- 19:00 + 2 hours = 21:00 AWST.\n\nThus, the start and end times of the first meeting in Wiluna, WA, considering the provided and calculated information, would actually pertain to the second meeting's timing in Wiluna's perspective. The question seems to ask for the first meeting's timing in Wiluna, which, based on the provided sequence, would be the meeting that starts after the one with Puerto Williams ends, but since we're calculating for the start and end times in Wiluna's DST (if it were to observe DST, which typically it does not as Western Australia), and given the confusion in the question's phrasing regarding \"first meeting\" in the context of Wiluna, WA, we proceed with the direct calculation provided.\n\nGiven the direct calculation for the timing after the conference with Puerto Williams and considering the potential misunderstanding in the question's intent regarding DST observation in Wiluna, WA, the times calculated pertain to the sequence of events as described. However, the precise answer to the question as it seems to be intended (considering a misunderstanding in the explanation process) would focus on the timing in Wiluna, WA, after the DST adjustment in Fort Chipewyan and the conference timing. \n\nTherefore, focusing strictly on the calculation without further elaboration:\n17:00 to 19:00 AWST.",

Thus, considering the spirit of the question might be about understanding time conversions and DST impacts:\n\nThe times given are already in the time zone of Bario, Kelabit Highlands, which does not change due to DST since Malaysia does not observe DST. \n\nGiven the strict format requirement and the confusion around the question's intent regarding DST observation in Bario, the direct answer based on calculations provided would be the times calculated for Bario, but acknowledging the format must be followed to the letter, and the question's request for \"(TRUE/FALSE)\" or a specific letter which does not apply here, the response must still adhere to the instruction for a final answer, which in this context, seems to be a misunderstanding since the question doesn't fit the TRUE/FALSE or A, B, C, D format but requires a time. \n\nGiven the constraints and the requirement for a specific format that does not match the question's need for a time answer, and to follow instructions precisely without further explanation or deviation:\n\n02:00",

        "response": "To determine the start and end times of the meetings, we first need to establish the time difference between Fort Chipewyan, AB, and the other locations. \n\n1. Fort Chipewyan, AB to Puerto Williams: Puerto Williams is in Chile and observes UTC-3 when not on DST. Assuming Fort Chipewyan starts DST at 02:00, moving to UTC-6 from UTC-7, and considering Puerto Williams' time zone, there's a 3-hour difference when neither is on DST. When Fort Chipewyan starts DST, this difference becomes 3 hours as well because Puerto Williams would be at UTC-3.\n\n2. Fort Chipewyan, AB to Neumayer-Station III: Neumayer-Station III is in Antarctica and typically observes UTC+0 (or sometimes considered as UTC without offset for simplicity in some contexts) when considering standard time zones, but for simplicity in calculations with other locations, we'll consider it as observing UTC (UTC+0) year-round since Antarctica doesn't follow traditional DST rules uniformly across all stations.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The first meeting starts at 02:00 DST (UTC-6) in Fort Chipewyan and lasts for 2 hours, ending at 04:00 DST (UTC-6).\n- The second meeting starts immediately after, at 04:00 DST (UTC-6) in Fort Chipewyan.\n\nTo convert these times to Neumayer-Station III's time (considered as UTC for simplicity), we need to account for the UTC offset:\n- Fort Chipewyan at DST is UTC-6.\n- Neumayer-Station III is considered as UTC.\n\nSo, for the second meeting:\n- Start time in Fort Chipewyan: 04:00 DST (which is 04:00 UTC-6).\n- To convert to UTC (Neumayer-Station III's time), we add 6 hours: 04:00 + 6 hours = 10:00 UTC.\n- The meeting lasts for 2 hours, so it ends at 10:00 + 2 hours = 12:00 UTC.\n\nThus, the start and end times of the second meeting in Neumayer-Station III, in DST terms as requested but noting Neumayer-Station III doesn't observe DST, would be 10:00 and 12:00 UTC, respectively.",

Fort Chipewyan, AB to Puerto Williams time difference is -2 hours (Puerto Williams is UTC-3, and Fort Chipewyan is UTC-7, then -7 + 1 for DST = -6, so -3 - (-6) = 3, but since Puerto Williams doesn't observe DST in March, it remains -2 after DST starts in Fort Chipewyan).\n2.

Fort Chipewyan, AB to Puerto Williams: Puerto Williams is in Chile, which is UTC-3. Fort Chipewyan is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7). When DST begins, Fort Chipewyan moves to MDT (UTC-6). So, the difference is 3 hours behind Fort Chipewyan during DST.\n\n2. Fort Chipewyan, AB to Simikot, Humla: Simikot is in Nepal, which is UTC+5:45. The difference is 11 hours and 45 minutes ahead of Fort Chipewyan.\n\nGiven the start time of the first meeting in Fort Chipewyan is 2026-03-08 02:00 (just as DST begins, so it's 03:00 MDT), \n\n- The start time in Puerto Williams would be 2026-03-08 00:00 (since it's 3 hours behind).\n- The end time of the first meeting in Fort Chipewyan is 2026-03-08 05:00 MDT.\n- The start time of the second meeting in Simikot, Humla, considering the 11 hours and 45 minutes difference, would be 2026-03-08 16:45 (MDT + 11 hours 45 minutes).\n- The end time of the second meeting in Simikot, Humla, would be 2 hours later, which is 2026-03-08 18:45.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the start and end times of the first meeting in Simikot, Humla in DST, and given that the first meeting actually takes place in Puerto Williams, we need to adjust our understanding to reflect the question's apparent confusion. If we're discussing the meeting that starts in Fort Chipewyan and considering its timing in Simikot, Humla:\n\n- Start time in Simikot, Humla for the \"first meeting\" (which started in Fort Chipewyan) would be 2026-03-08 03:00 MDT + 11 hours 45 minutes = 2026-03-08 14:45.\n- End time would be 2 hours later, 2026-03-08 16:45.\n\nGiven the confusion in the question, the most direct interpretation regarding the \"first meeting\" in Simikot, Humla, based on standard time conversions, would be:\n\n14:45 to 16:45.",

However, the question asks for the meeting in Hanga Roa, which is in UTC-6 during standard time but does not observe DST like Fort Chipewyan does in this context. \n\nGiven Hanga Roa does not change its clock for DST in the same manner as Fort Chipewyan, and assuming it remains in its standard time zone equivalent to UTC-6 (like before DST in Fort Chipewyan), the time difference between Hanga Roa and Fort Chipewyan after DST begins would be 1 hour, because Fort Chipewyan has moved 1 hour ahead.\n\nSo, when it's 05:00 in Fort Chipewyan (DST), it would be 04:00 in Hanga Roa.\n\nThe second meeting starts at 04:00 in Hanga Roa and lasts 2 hours, ending at 06:00.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for times in DST for Hanga Roa, but Hanga Roa doesn't observe DST in the traditional sense or as described for Fort Chipewyan, and assuming a hypothetical DST for Hanga Roa would also move its clock forward by 1 hour, the start and end times in a hypothetical DST for Hanga Roa would be:\n- Start: 05:00\n- End: 07:00",

Fort Chipewyan is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7) and observes DST, which would put it at UTC-6 when DST is in effect. Puerto Williams is in the Magallanes Region of Chile, which is UTC-3. San Pedro de Macorís is in the Dominican Republic, which is UTC-4.\n\nGiven that DST begins in Fort Chipewyan at 02:00 on 2026-03-08, this means the local time jumps from 01:59 to 03:00. \n\n1. The video conference with Puerto Williams starts at 03:00 Fort Chipewyan time (UTC-6) and lasts for 2 hours, ending at 05:00 Fort Chipewyan time.\n\n2. To find the time in Puerto Williams (UTC-3) when the conference starts and ends, we convert Fort Chipewyan time to Puerto Williams time:\n   - Start time in Fort Chipewyan: 03:00 (UTC-6)\n   - Converted to UTC: 03:00 + 6 hours = 09:00 UTC\n   - Converted to Puerto Williams time (UTC-3): 09:00 UTC - 3 hours = 06:00\n   - End time in Fort Chipewyan: 05:00 (UTC-6)\n   - Converted to UTC: 05:00 + 6 hours = 11:00 UTC\n   - Converted to Puerto Williams time (UTC-3): 11:00 UTC - 3 hours = 08:00\n\n3. The meeting in San Pedro de Macorís starts the moment the first meeting ends and lasts for 2 hours. Since the first meeting ends at 08:00 Puerto Williams time, we need to convert this to San Pedro de Macorís time (UTC-4).\n   - End time of the first meeting in Puerto Williams: 08:00 (UTC-3)\n   - Converted to UTC: 08:00 + 3 hours = 11:00 UTC\n   - Converted to San Pedro de Macorís time (UTC-4): 11:00 UTC - 4 hours = 07:00\n\n4. The meeting in San Pedro de Macorís lasts for 2 hours, so it ends at:\n   - 07:00 + 2 hours = 09:00 San Pedro de Macorís time.\n\nThus, the start and end times of the first meeting in San Pedro de Macorís, considering DST, are 07:00 and 09:00, respectively.",

However, the question asks for the start and end times of the \"first meeting in Kayseri,\" which actually refers to the second meeting as described, since the first meeting is with Puerto Williams. \n\nGiven the confusion and focusing strictly on the question's wording about the \"first meeting in Kayseri,\" which seems to be the meeting starting after the one with Puerto Williams, the times provided are for this second meeting. The actual \"first meeting\" as per the question's possible interpretation (the one with Puerto Williams) does not occur in Kayseri but is referenced to understand the timing of the meeting in Kayseri. \n\nTherefore, considering the direct question about the \"first meeting in Kayseri\" and the provided sequence, the times are for the meeting after the Puerto Williams conference, but since the question seems to have a mix-up in its logic regarding \"first meeting in Kayseri,\" the times calculated are indeed for the meeting that starts after the conference with Puerto Williams, and thus are correctly identified as starting at 12:00 and ending at 14:00 in Kayseri's time, assuming DST is in effect or the times are as per DST schedule. \n\n12:00-14:00",

The video conference starts at 03:00 DST (UTC-6) in Fort Chipewyan.\n2. It ends 2 hours later, at 05:00 DST (UTC-6).\n\nNow, converting this to Vostok Station time (UTC+5), considering the 11-hour difference (UTC-6 to UTC+5):\n\n- Start time in Vostok Station: 03:00 (UTC-6) + 11 hours = 14:00 (UTC+5).\n- End time in Vostok Station: 05:00 (UTC-6) + 11 hours = 16:00 (UTC+5).\n\nThe second meeting starts the moment the first meeting ends and lasts for 2 hours. Thus, in Vostok Station time:\n\n- Start of the second meeting: 16:00 (UTC+5).\n- End of the second meeting: 16:00 + 2 hours = 18:00 (UTC+5).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the start and end times of the \"first meeting\" in Vostok Station in DST, which seems to be a misunderstanding since the first meeting's times were given, and the calculation led to the times of the meetings in Vostok Station. Assuming the intent was to ask for the times of the meetings as calculated:\n\nThe first meeting in Vostok Station starts at 14:00 and ends at 16:00.",

Ushuaia is UTC-3, and when DST begins in Fort Chipewyan (UTC-6 becomes UTC-7 for DST in some areas but Fort Chipewyan stays UTC-7 or -6 depending, however assuming standard -7 for simplicity before DST and it moves to -6), the difference would be 3 hours apart when considering Ushuaia's standard time.\n\nHowever, considering Fort Chipewyan moves to DST (assuming it moves to UTC-6 for simplicity), and Ushuaia's time, the meeting starts at 02:00 in Fort Chipewyan, which would be 05:00 in Ushuaia (considering the 3-hour difference).\n\nThe meeting lasts 2 hours, ending at 04:00 in Fort Chipewyan DST (which started at 02:00) and 07:00 in Ushuaia.\n\nNow, Taiohae, Marquesas is UTC-9:30. The difference between Ushuaia (UTC-3) and Taiohae (UTC-9:30) is 6.5 hours.\n\nSo, when it's 07:00 in Ushuaia, in Taiohae it would be 07:00 - 6.5 hours = 00:30 the previous day.\n\nThe second meeting starts at this time and lasts 2 hours, ending at 02:30.\n\nGiven the question asks for the start and end times of the first meeting in Taiohae, Marquesas in DST, but since the first meeting's timing is what we used to calculate the start of the second, and there seems to be confusion in the question's request for \"first meeting\" times in Taiohae, considering the provided steps and focusing on the calculation directly related to the first meeting's timing as it applies to the schedule in Taiohae:\n\nStart of the first meeting in Taiohae's time zone, considering Fort Chipewyan's DST start time (02:00) and accounting for the time difference (Fort Chipewyan to Ushuaia to Taiohae), the first meeting's timing in Taiohae would directly correlate to the timing after adjusting for DST and time zones.\n\nGiven Fort Chipewyan's 02:00 DST start, and adjusting through Ushuaia's time to Taiohae's, the direct calculation for the first meeting in Taiohae's time, based on the provided steps and focusing on the initial meeting's timing as it translates across time zones, would reflect the adjusted start time for the first meeting in Taiohae's DST, which would be the basis for calculating the subsequent meeting's start time.\n\nThus, considering the direct question and focusing on the calculation provided, the first meeting's start and end times in Taiohae, based on the initial meeting's start in Fort Chipewyan and adjusting for DST and time zones, would reflect the timing as calculated through the provided steps. \n\n00:30 to 02:30",

Arawa, Bougainville is at UTC+11, which is 8 hours ahead of Ushuaia (UTC-3) during Ushuaia's standard time and 9 hours ahead during Ushuaia's DST, but since Ushuaia does not observe DST on the same date, we consider their standard time for this calculation.\n6.

However, Chile's DST typically starts in September and ends in March, so by March 8, Chile might have already ended DST, but for this scenario, let's consider the time difference assuming both are in their respective DST or standard times without the exact DST rules for each location.\n\nGiven Fort Chipewyan (UTC-6 with DST) is 3 hours behind Ushuaia (UTC-3), and assuming San Pedro de Atacama is also in UTC-3 for this scenario:\n- When it's 05:00 in Fort Chipewyan, it would be 08:00 in Ushuaia and San Pedro de Atacama.\n\nThe meeting in San Pedro de Atacama starts after the first meeting ends, so it begins at 08:00 and lasts 2 hours, ending at 10:00.",

However, the DST start and end dates can vary, but typically DST starts on the last Sunday of March and ends on the last Sunday of October.\n\nGiven the date 2026-03-08, and assuming Algeria starts DST on the last Sunday of March (which would be 2026-03-30), on 2026-03-08, Tamanrasset would still be on standard time (CET, UTC+1).\n\nFort Chipewyan, AB, is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7) and observes DST, so when it's 03:00 DST (MDT, UTC-6) on 2026-03-08:\n- The time difference between MDT (UTC-6) and CET (UTC+1) is 7 hours.\n\nSo, when it's 03:00 MDT in Fort Chipewyan:\n- It would be 10:00 CET in Tamanrasset.\n\nThe first meeting ends at 05:00 MDT, which would be:\n- 12:00 CET in Tamanrasset.\n\nThe second meeting starts at 12:00 CET and lasts 2 hours, ending at 14:00 CET.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the start and end times of the first meeting in Tamanrasset in DST, and given that Tamanrasset has not yet entered DST as of 2026-03-08:\n- The first meeting's start time in Tamanrasset would be 10:00 CET, and its end time would be 12:00 CET.\n\nBut since the question specifically mentions \"in DST\" for Tamanrasset, and considering Tamanrasset's DST (CEST) would start later:\n- If we were to consider the equivalent times after Tamanrasset enters DST (which is not the case on 2026-03-08 but following the instruction):\n    - Tamanrasset's DST (CEST) is UTC+2, so the time difference with MDT (UTC-6) would be 8 hours.\n    - When it's 03:00 MDT, it would be 11:00 CEST.\n    - The meeting ends at 05:00 MDT, which would be 13:00 CEST.\n\nGiven the confusion and the specifics of the question asking for times \"in DST\" for Tamanrasset, which doesn't apply on the date given:\n- The direct answer based on standard procedure without considering the DST mention for Tamanrasset (since it's not in DST on the given date) would be the times in standard time, but the question's phrasing suggests a consideration for DST times, which is not applicable on 2026-03-08 for Tamanrasset.\n\nThus, strictly following the question's request for \"in DST\" and considering the standard interpretation of such a scenario:\n10:00-12:00 CET is the time before DST, but considering the DST mention:\n11:00-13:00 CEST.",

Baikonur Cosmodrome (UTC+5, then UTC+6 is not observed, remains UTC+5 in summer for simplicity, but actually observes UTC+5 year-round as it does not follow DST like the question implies for Fort Chipewyan)\n\nGiven:\n- The video conference starts at 02:00 (pre-DST) in Fort Chipewyan, which is 02:00 UTC-7.\n- DST begins at this moment, so the clock jumps to 03:00 (post-DST) UTC-6.\n- The conference lasts 2 hours, ending at 05:00 UTC-6 in Fort Chipewyan.\n\nNow, converting the start and end times to Baikonur Cosmodrome time (UTC+5):\n- Start time in Fort Chipewyan after DST: 03:00 UTC-6\n- Convert to UTC: 03:00 UTC-6 = 09:00 UTC\n- Convert to Baikonur Cosmodrome time (UTC+5): 09:00 UTC = 14:00 UTC+5\n- End time in Fort Chipewyan after DST: 05:00 UTC-6\n- Convert to UTC: 05:00 UTC-6 = 11:00 UTC\n- Convert to Baikonur Cosmodrome time (UTC+5): 11:00 UTC = 16:00 UTC+5\n\nThe second meeting starts at the end of the first, so it begins at 16:00 UTC+5 in Baikonur Cosmodrome and lasts for 2 hours, ending at 18:00 UTC+5.\n\nThus, the start and end times of the first meeting in Baikonur Cosmodrome, considering the question's likely intent about DST observation, are not directly asked but the times for the second meeting are derived as 16:00 to 18:00.

Fort Chipewyan, AB to Ushuaia time difference is -2 hours (assuming Ushuaia is UTC-3 and Fort Chipewyan is UTC-7 before DST, then -1 hour after DST starts).\n2.

Fort Chipewyan, AB to Ushuaia time difference is -2 hours in standard time, but since Ushuaia does not observe DST in the same manner, and assuming Ushuaia is in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego province which is UTC-3, and Fort Chipewyan is UTC-7, then UTC-7 + 1 (for DST) = UTC-6, Ushuaia is UTC-3, so the difference is 3 hours ahead of Fort Chipewyan during DST.\n   \n2. The video conference starts at 02:00 (DST begins) in Fort Chipewyan and lasts 2 hours, so it ends at 04:00 DST.\n\n3. Converting this to Ushuaia time: Since Ushuaia is 3 hours ahead, the start time would be 02:00 + 3 = 05:00, and the end time would be 04:00 + 3 = 07:00 Ushuaia time.\n\n4. Bongao, Tawi-Tawi is in the Philippines, which is UTC+8. The time difference between Ushuaia (UTC-3) and Bongao (UTC+8) is 11 hours.\n\n5. The meeting in Bongao starts when the Ushuaia meeting ends, which is 07:00 Ushuaia time. Converting this to Bongao time: 07:00 + 11 = 18:00.\n\n6. The meeting lasts 2 hours, so it ends at 18:00 + 2 = 20:00 Bongao time.\n\nGiven Fort Chipewyan's DST start, the first meeting in Bongao, Tawi-Tawi starts at 18:00 and ends at 20:00.",

Fort Chipewyan, AB to Ushuaia, Argentina time difference is -3 hours during standard time and -2 hours during DST, considering Ushuaia does not observe DST in the same manner.\n2. The video conference starts at 02:00 DST in Fort Chipewyan, which is 00:00 in Ushuaia (considering the -2 hour difference during DST).\n3. The conference ends 2 hours later, at 04:00 DST in Fort Chipewyan, which would be 02:00 in Ushuaia.\n4. Agatti, Lakshadweep is +9.5 hours ahead of Fort Chipewyan during standard time and +8.5 hours during DST.\n5. The second meeting starts at the end of the first, so at 04:00 DST in Fort Chipewyan, which translates to 12:30 DST in Agatti, Lakshadweep.\n6. The second meeting lasts for 2 hours, ending at 14:30 DST in Agatti, Lakshadweep.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the start and end times of the \"first meeting\" in Agatti, Lakshadweep, which seems to be a misunderstanding since the first meeting is between Fort Chipewyan and Ushuaia. Assuming the intent was to ask about the meeting times in Agatti, Lakshadweep for the meeting that starts after the first one ends:\n\nStart time in Agatti, Lakshadweep for the second meeting (considered as the first meeting in Agatti): 12:30\nEnd time in Agatti, Lakshadweep for the second meeting: 14:30\n\nGiven the format requirement and the confusion in the question, the answer to provide based on the calculation for the start and end times of the meeting in Agatti, Lakshadweep, considering it as the \"first meeting\" in that location, would be the times calculated. However, since the format demands a single token and it seems there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the question's request for a specific format answer (A, B, C, D, TRUE, FALSE), the correct interpretation of the question seems to be about calculating times rather than selecting from options.

The video conference starts at 03:00 (DST) and lasts 2 hours, ending at 05:00 (DST).\n3. The meeting in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur starts after the video conference, at 05:00 (DST in Fort Chipewyan), and lasts 2 hours.\n\nNikolayevsk-on-Amur is 13 hours ahead of Fort Chipewyan during standard time, but since Fort Chipewyan is on DST, it's effectively 12 hours behind Nikolayevsk-on-Amur during this period.\n\nSo, when it's 05:00 in Fort Chipewyan (DST), in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur it would be:\n05:00 + 12 hours = 17:00.\n\nThe meeting lasts 2 hours, ending at:\n17:00 + 2 hours = 19:00.\n\nThus, the start and end times of the first meeting in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, considering DST adjustments, are 17:00 to 19:00.",

If Fort Chipewyan is UTC-6 with DST, and Pointe-à-Pitre is UTC-4 with DST, Pointe-à-Pitre is 2 hours ahead.\n\nSo, when the first meeting ends at 05:00 DST in Fort Chipewyan, it would be 07:00 DST in Pointe-à-Pitre. The second meeting lasts 2 hours:\n- Starts at 07:00 DST and ends at 09:00 DST in Pointe-à-Pitre.",

However, the question seems to be asking for the timing of the meeting that started in Fort Chipewyan and Ushuaia, in Malatya's time zone, which would be the time the conference started and ended in Malatya's perspective.\n\nGiven the confusion, and focusing strictly on the question's possible interpretation regarding the \"first meeting\" in Malatya's DST context, and considering typical DST adjustments:\nThe start time in Malatya for the conference that began in Fort Chipewyan would be 14:00 (as calculated for the end of the conference), but this seems to be a misunderstanding of the question's intent.\n\nCorrecting for the intent to find the start and end times of the \"first meeting\" as it relates to Malatya's time zone and considering DST, if we were to directly translate the start of DST in Fort Chipewyan to Malatya's time, considering the DST start time and its relation to the meeting times:\nThe actual question seems to be about the timing in Malatya, considering DST starts in Fort Chipewyan.\n\nThus, focusing on the timing provided and the typical format for such questions:\nThe first meeting's start and end times, considering the context provided and focusing on the Malatya time frame, would actually be based on when the meeting started and ended in Fort Chipewyan, translated to Malatya time, but given the details, the direct answer to the question as it might be interpreted in the context of start and end times in Malatya, considering DST, would be the times when the meetings would occur in Malatya, based on the information given.\n\nGiven the strict format requirement and the need to provide a direct answer without further explanation:\n14:00-16:00",
