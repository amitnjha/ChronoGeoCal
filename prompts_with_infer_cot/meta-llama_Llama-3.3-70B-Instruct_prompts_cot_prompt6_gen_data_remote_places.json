Assuming standard time for simplicity (UTC+13 for Samoa), the time difference is 16 hours.\n\nIf it's 15:01 in Puerto Williams (UTC-3), it would be 15:01 + 16 hours = 07:01 the next day in Manono.\n\nHowever, considering the Hebrew calendar date given and without specific details on how to handle the date conversion for the events' timing, the focus is on the time calculation based on the provided scenario.\n\nThus, the earliest possible start time for Event B in Manono, considering only the time and not adjusting for the date change due to the time zone difference, would be 07:01 the next day in local time, but since the question asks for the time in the Hebrew Calendar and given the complexity of converting this specific time and date directly, the answer focuses on the time calculation aspect directly related to the events. \n\n07:01",

So, when it's 15:01 in Puerto Williams, it's 14:01 in Santo Domingo, but since Event B's start time is determined by the end of Event A and the requirement for a 1-hour delay, we consider the time difference.\n\nThus, the earliest possible start time for Event B in Santo Domingo, considering the 1-hour difference, would be 15:01 - 1 hour = 14:01 in Puerto Williams time, which translates to 13:01 in Santo Domingo time, but since Event B must start after 15:01 Puerto Williams time (to account for the 1-hour delay after Event A), it would start at 14:01 Santo Domingo time.\n\nHowever, considering the direct question, the calculation error led to confusion. The correct approach directly calculates the end of Event A and adds the waiting period without mixing time zones in the final step:\n\nEvent A ends at 14:01 in Puerto Williams. \nAdding 1 hour for the delay before Event B starts gives 15:01 in Puerto Williams.\nConverting this to Santo Domingo time (1 hour back) gives 14:01.\n\nThe correct answer, following the specified format strictly and correcting the approach for determining the start time of Event B in Santo Domingo local time, should directly reflect the time after accounting for the delay and time zone difference without further elaboration. \n\n14:01",

Adjusting for the time zone difference (UTC-3 to UTC-4), we subtract 1 hour: 15:01 - 1 hour = 14:01.\n\nHowever, the task is to find the earliest start time in Castries local time, considering the conditions. The confusion arises from misinterpreting the time zone adjustment in relation to the event timing conditions. \n\nThe correct approach should directly consider the timing and delay without incorrectly adjusting for time zones in the explanation of the calculation process. \n\nGiven the conditions and focusing on the timing: Event A ends, and then 1 hour later, Event B can start. The time zone difference (1 hour) between Puerto Williams and Castries means when it's 15:01 in Puerto Williams, it's 14:01 in Castries. But since we're looking for the earliest start time of Event B after Event A ends and the additional 1-hour wait, the calculation directly relates to when Event A ends and the delay, not the time zone adjustment for the start of Event B.\n\nTherefore, considering the direct question of the earliest possible start time for Event B in Castries, given Event A's timing and the conditions provided, and correcting for the proper interpretation of the task:\n\nThe earliest possible start time for Event B, given it must start at least 1 hour after Event A ends, and considering the time difference, would directly relate to the end time of Event A plus the delay, then considering the local time in Castries based on the provided start time of Event A.\n\nGiven this, and directly answering the question without further elaboration: \n\n14:01",
