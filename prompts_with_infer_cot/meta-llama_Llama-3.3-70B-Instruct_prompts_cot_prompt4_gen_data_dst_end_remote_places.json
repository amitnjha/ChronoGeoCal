        "response": "To solve this, we first need to establish the time difference and how daylight saving time (DST) affects the departure and arrival times.\n\n1. **Establish the departure time in a standard time format**: כ״א חשון תשפ״ז translates to November 6, 2026, in the Gregorian calendar. Daylight Saving Time (DST) ends on the first Sunday of November, which in 2026 falls on November 1. However, since the question specifies November 6, DST has already ended in Fort Chipewyan, AB. Assuming the DST change happens at 2 AM, and considering Fort Chipewyan is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC-7), and it's after the DST change, it would be UTC-7.\n\n2. **Determine the time in Fort Chipewyan when DST ends**: Since DST ends, clocks \"fall back\" one hour. If it's 2 AM DST, it becomes 1 AM standard time. However, the question implies the flight departs at the exact moment DST ends, which would be 1 AM Mountain Standard Time (MST) on November 6, 2026.\n\n3. **Calculate the arrival time in London, considering the time zone difference**: London is in the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) +0 time zone during standard time. The time difference between MST (UTC-7) and GMT (UTC+0) is 7 hours. So, if it's 1 AM MST, it would be 8 AM GMT.\n\n4. **Account for the flight duration**: The flight is 6 hours long. Adding 6 hours to 8 AM GMT gives us 2 PM GMT.\n\n5. **Convert the arrival time to Kiritimati (Christmas Island) time**: Kiritimati is 14 hours ahead of GMT. So, adding 14 hours to 2 PM GMT gives us 4 AM the next day in Kiritimati time.\n\n6. **Convert the arrival date and time to the Hebrew calendar**: The arrival time in GMT is 2 PM on November 6, 2026. Adding 14 hours to reach Kiritimati time, we get 4 AM on November 7, 2026. November 7, 2026, translates to כ״ז חשון תשפ״ז in the Hebrew calendar.\n\nTherefore, the flight arrives at 4 AM on כ״ז חשון תשפ״ז in Kiritimati.",

The time difference is 12 hours and 30 minutes. \n\n4. **Calculate Arrival Time in Destination Time Zone**: \n   - First, convert 7:00 AM to UTC: 7:00 AM - 7 hours = 12:00 PM (noon) UTC.\n   - Then, convert UTC to India Time: 12:00 PM + 5 hours 30 minutes = 5:30 PM.\n\n5. **Hebrew Calendar Date at Destination**: Since the flight departs on כ״א חשון and travels for 6 hours, and considering the significant time zone difference, the date could change. However, given the time zone difference and the flight duration, the arrival would still be on the same Hebrew calendar date, as the time difference primarily affects the hour of the day rather than the day itself in this scenario.\n\n**Arrival Time**: 5:30 PM on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

If we assume the flight departs exactly at 2:00 AM (when the time change typically occurs), it would depart at 1:00 AM in the new time because clocks fall back.\n\n2. **Calculate Arrival Time**: The flight duration is 6 hours. Adding 6 hours to 1:00 AM gives us 7:00 AM local time at the departure location.\n\n3. **Consider Destination Time Zone**: Avarua, Cook Islands, is UTC-10. Fort Chipewyan, AB, Canada, is UTC-7 (considering it observes daylight saving time, but since it just fell back, it's in standard time). The difference is 3 hours behind Fort Chipewyan.\n\n4. **Adjust for Time Zone**: If it's 7:00 AM in Fort Chipewyan, subtracting 3 hours for the time zone difference gives us 4:00 AM in Avarua.\n\n5. **Hebrew Calendar Date at Destination**: Since Avarua is behind Fort Chipewyan, and considering the international date line, the date could potentially be the day before in Avarua when it's the same day in Fort Chipewyan, depending on the time of year and exact dates. However, given the specific date of כ״א חשון תשפ״ז and without converting it to a Gregorian date for simplicity, we'll focus on the time calculation.\n\nGiven these steps and without converting the Hebrew date to a Gregorian date for precise calculation:\n\n- **Local Time Arrival**: 4:00 AM\n- **Hebrew Calendar Date**: Assuming no date change due to the international date line for simplicity, it remains כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

However, since the question implies a clock change, we'll consider the post-DST time for both, making Fort Chipewyan UTC-7 and San Fernando UTC-8 after the change.\n\nGiven the flight departs at the exact time of the clock change (let's say 2 AM, as the specific time isn't given but typically DST changes occur at 2 AM), and considering the time difference:\n\n- Fort Chipewyan falls back to 1 AM (UTC-7).\n- San Fernando, being one hour behind Fort Chipewyan after the change, would be UTC-8, so if it's 1 AM in Fort Chipewyan, it's 12 AM (midnight) in San Fernando.\n\nThe flight duration is 6 hours, so:\n- Departure from Fort Chipewyan: 1 AM (local time after falling back).\n- Arrival in San Fernando: 12 AM + 6 hours = 6 AM (local time).\n\nConverting the arrival date back to the Hebrew calendar, November 6, 2026, corresponds to כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, and since the flight arrives on the same day (considering the time zones and the specific details given), the Hebrew calendar date remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the flight arrives at 6 AM on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

After the fall back, it would be AKST.\n\nCorvo, Azores is in the Azores Time Zone (AZOT), which is UTC-1, but during standard time, it is UTC-1, and it does not observe daylight saving time in the same manner as the US.\n\nThe time difference between AKST (UTC-9) and AZOT (UTC-1) is 8 hours.\n\nIf the flight departs at 1 AM AKST, to find the arrival time in Corvo:\n1 AM AKST + 8 hours = 9 AM AZOT.\n\nAdding the 6-hour flight duration:\n9 AM AZOT + 6 hours = 3 PM AZOT.\n\nSo, the flight arrives at 3 PM local time in Corvo.\n\nTo convert this to the Hebrew calendar date, since the flight departs on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז and travels for 6 hours, arriving in the afternoon, it's still the same Hebrew calendar date because the date changes at sunset, which would be later than the arrival time.\n\nTherefore, the arrival time in both local time and Hebrew calendar date is 3 PM on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.",

Assuming it follows a standard time zone for simplicity, let's consider it might follow New Zealand Time (NZDT, UTC+13) during their summer, given the lack of specific information.\n\nTime difference between AKST (UTC-9) and NZDT (UTC+13) is 22 hours.\n\nIf the flight departs exactly when DST ends (which would be 2 AM AKDT becoming 1 AM AKST), and considering the flight duration and time difference:\n\nDeparture Time (AKST): 1 AM (November 7, 2026)\nFlight Duration: 6 hours\nArrival Time (AKST): 7 AM (November 7, 2026)\n\nConsidering the 22-hour time difference to NZDT:\n7 AM (AKST) - 22 hours = 11 PM (November 6, 2026, NZDT), but since we've crossed into a new day in AKST, and considering the international date line, the date in NZDT would actually be November 8, 2026.\n\nTo convert the arrival date back into the Hebrew calendar:\nNovember 8, 2026, corresponds to כ״ז חשון תשפ״ז‎.\n\nSo, the flight arrives at 11 PM on כ״ז חשון תשפ״ז‎ in Concordia Station local time.",

The time difference between Alaska (UTC-9) and a hypothetical UTC+5:30 for Maitri would be 14.5 hours ahead.\n\nSo, if it's 8 AM in Anaktuvuk Pass, AK, you would add 14.5 hours to get the time in Maitri Station: 8 AM + 14 hours = 10 PM, and then add the 0.5 hours (30 minutes), resulting in 10:30 PM on the same day in Maitri Station local time.\n\nGiven the Hebrew calendar date starts in the evening, the flight departs on כ״א חשון and arrives on כ״ב חשון due to crossing the international date line and the significant time difference. \n\nThus, the arrival time in local time at Maitri Station would be 10:30 PM, and in the Hebrew calendar, it would be כ״ב חשון תשפ״ז.",

Anaktuvuk Pass, AK is in the Alaska Time Zone (UTC-9), and Coari, Brazil is in the Amazon Time Zone (UTC-3), which is 6 hours ahead of Alaska Time during standard time.\n- So, converting 7 AM Alaska Time to Coari time: 7 AM + 6 hours = 1 PM Coari time.\n\nGiven the date and time change:\n- The departure date is November 6, 2026.\n- Since the flight is 6 hours long and crosses into a new time zone 6 hours ahead, and considering the time change, the arrival would still be on November 6, 2026, in Coari, but in the Hebrew calendar, this corresponds to כ״ב חשון תשפ״ז.\n\nThus, the arrival time in Coari is 1 PM local time on כ״ב חשון תשפ״ז.",

Daylight Saving Time (DST) ends on the first Sunday of November, which in 2026 falls on November 1. However, since the specific date given is November 6, and assuming the question intends for DST to end on this date for the sake of the problem (despite the actual date being November 1), we proceed with the understanding that clocks \"fall back\" one hour at 2 AM local time.\n\n2. **Time Zone Difference**: Anaktuvuk Pass, AK, is in the Alaska Time Zone (AKST), which is UTC-9. Santiago, Chile, is in the Chile Standard Time Zone (CLT), which is UTC-3 during standard time and UTC-3 does not change as Chile does not observe DST in the same manner as the US, but for simplicity, we'll consider it as UTC-3. The time difference is 6 hours (UTC-9 to UTC-3).\n\n3. **Flight Departure and Arrival**:\n   - **Departure Time**: Assuming the flight departs exactly when DST ends (2 AM AKST), and considering the \"fall back\" to standard time, the new time would technically be 1 AM AKST (since clocks move back one hour).\n   - **Arrival Time Calculation**: The flight duration is 6 hours. Adding this to the departure time (1 AM AKST), we get 7 AM AKST. Then, considering the 6-hour time difference (AKST to CLT), we add 6 hours to 7 AM AKST, resulting in 1 PM CLT.\n\n4. **Hebrew Calendar Date at Destination**: Since the flight departs on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז (November 6, 2026), and considering the travel time and time zones, the arrival would still be on the same Hebrew calendar date, as the travel time does not exceed 24 hours.\n\n**Arrival Time in Local Time**: 1 PM\n**Hebrew Calendar Date at Destination**: כ״א חשון תשפ״ז",
