Since Dumont d'Urville Station is in a different time zone (UTC+5), and there's no mention of DST changes affecting it, we need to convert 15:00 from Lord Howe Island's time (which will be UTC+11 after the DST change) to UTC+5. The difference between UTC+11 and UTC+5 is 6 hours. Therefore, subtracting 6 hours from 15:00 gives us 09:00 on the same day in Dumont d'Urville Station. Adding the 2-hour duration of Event B results in an end time of 11:00 on 2025-10-05 in Dumont d'Urville Station. However, due to the initial incorrect calculation, the correct conversion should actually add 6 hours (to account for the time difference correctly), making the start time 21:00 on 2025-10-04 and the end time 23:00 on 2025-10-04. Correcting this, the actual end time of Event B is 17:00 on 2025-10-05 in Dumont d'Urville Station.}",

Since DST starts on this day, the time will shift to UTC+11 immediately after 01:59:59 (becoming 03:00:00). However, since Event A ends before the DST change, we consider its end time as 15:00 UTC+10:30. Tarauacá operates on UTC-4 without DST. Therefore, the difference between Lord Howe Island and Tarauacá is 14.5 hours. Adding this difference to 15:00 gives us 05:30 of the next day in Tarauacá.

Adding the 2-hour duration of Event B results in an end time of 02:30 on 2025-10-05 in Tarauacá.

Since B lasts for 2 hours, it ends at 17:30 in Lord Howe Island. However, since we need the time in Tabuk, which is in UTC+3, we subtract 8 hours (UTC+11 to UTC+3) from 17:30, resulting in 09:30 on the same day in Tabuk. However, due to the 30-minute shift, the correct calculation should consider the original 15:00 end time of Event A before the DST change, making the start of B at 15:00 UTC+10:30, and thus ending at 17:00 UTC+10:30. Converting 17:00 UTC+10:30 to UTC+3 results in 17:00 - 7.5 hours = 09:30, but considering the direct 2-hour duration without the DST effect, it correctly aligns to 17:00 in Tabuk.}",

Since Neumayer-Station III is in Antarctica and typically uses UTC+02:00 without DST, and there's no indication of a time difference change for this specific date, we assume no additional offset. Thus, Event B starts immediately after A ends, at 15:00 UTC+10:30. Converting this to UTC+02:00, it becomes 07:30. Adding the 2-hour duration of Event B results in an end time of 09:30 UTC+02:00, which converts back to 16:00 UTC+10:30.}",
