Amritsar is UTC+5:30, and when it's 02:00 in New York (UTC-5, before DST), it's 02:00 + 10.5 hours = 12:30 in Amritsar.\n\nAfter DST begins, New York becomes UTC-4, so when it's 04:00 in New York, it's 04:00 + 9.5 hours = 13:30 in Amritsar for the end of the first meeting.\n\nThe second meeting starts immediately after and lasts 2 hours, so it starts at 13:30 and ends at 15:30 in Amritsar.",

New York is 1 hour ahead, so 04:00 + 1 hour = 05:00.\n\nReykjavik is 5 hours ahead of New York during DST (since Reykjavik does not observe DST and is normally 5 hours ahead of New York during standard time, but during New York's DST, the difference remains 5 hours because Reykjavik's time doesn't change).\nSo, when it's 05:00 in New York, it's 10:00 in Reykjavik.\n\nThe meeting in Reykjavik starts at 10:00 and lasts 2 hours, so it ends at 12:00.",
