The flight departs at this exact time.\n3. The flight duration is 6 hours.\n4. After the time change, the local time in Fort Chipewyan is one hour earlier. So, the actual departure time in UTC is one hour later than the stated time.\n5. The flight arrives 6 hours later in UTC, which is 7 hours after the adjusted departure time in Fort Chipewyan.\n6. The destination is in Alaska, which is in the same time zone as Fort Chipewyan before the time change (AKST). So, the local time in Utqiaġvik (Barrow), AK, is the same as the adjusted departure time in Fort Chipewyan.\n7. To find the Hebrew calendar date at the destination, we need to add 6 hours to the adjusted departure time in Fort Chipewyan, which is still כ״א חשון תשפ״ז‎ (November 7, 2021).\n8.

The flight departs at this exact time, so it departs one hour earlier in local time.\n3. The flight duration is 6 hours.\n4.

In local time, the flight arrives at 5 PM (1 PM + 6 hours = 5 PM).\n7. In Anaktuvuk Pass, the local time is 4 PM (5 PM - 1 hour = 4 PM).\n8. Therefore, the flight arrives at 4 PM local time on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז.\n9. Since the flight departed on כ״א חשון תשפ״ז, it will arrive on the same Hebrew calendar date.\n10.
