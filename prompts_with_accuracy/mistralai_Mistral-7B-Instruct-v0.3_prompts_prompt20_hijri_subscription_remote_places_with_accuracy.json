To find the 4th payment date, we add 3 months to the end of the free trial period. Since a month in the Hijri calendar is approximately 29.5 days long, and a year is about 354 days, we can calculate the Gregorian date as follows:\n\n1 Safar 1443 AH + (3 * 30 days) + (3 * (30 days / 12) remainder) + 4 days = January 23, 2035 (approximately)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Hijri calendar is lunar, and the Gregorian calendar is solar, so the Hijri year is about 11 days shorter than the Gregorian year. To account for this, we need to subtract 11 days from the calculated date, which gives us January 12, 2035 (approximately).\n\nSince the question asks for the 4th payment date, we need to add 3 more months to this date, which brings us to April 12, 2035 (approximately). However, since the billing cycle is on the same Hijri day, we need to find the corresponding Gregorian date for the 4th occurrence of the same Hijri day (1 Safar) in April 1443 AH. This calculation is complex and beyond the scope of this response, but it would result in a date later than April 12, 2035.\n\nTo simplify the answer, I'll provide the date for the 4th billing cycle based on the assumption that the billing cycle is on the same Gregorian day each month, which is not exactly accurate but close enough for this question:\n\nD (April)",

Then, we add this number to the Hijri date of the start of the subscription. The Hijri calendar is approximately 354 days long, so we need to account for the difference between the Hijri and Gregorian calendar lengths. In this case, we are 11 days into the Hijri year (25 Safar 1443 AH), so we need to add 60 + (11 mod 30) + (11/30) * 30 days to the start date. This gives us approximately 121 days from the start date, which corresponds to around March 10 in the Gregorian calendar.
