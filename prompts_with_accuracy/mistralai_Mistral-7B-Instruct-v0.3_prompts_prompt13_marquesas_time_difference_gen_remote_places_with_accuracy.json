Convert the Marquesas Islands time to UTC:\n   -0930 hours = -0930 + 12 (from Enewetak Atoll) = -2330 hours (UTC)\n   -12:00 (from the question) + -2330 (conversion) = 2130 (UTC) on 2025-12-05\n\n2. Convert the Enewetak Atoll time to UTC:\n   +1200 hours = +1200 hours (no need for conversion) = 0000 (UTC) on 2025-12-06\n\n3. Now, let's find the difference between the two times:\n   2130 (UTC on 2025-12-05) - 0000 (UTC on 2025-12-06) = 2130 hours\n\n4. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert this difference to days: 2130 hours / 24 hours/day = 89.58 days\n\n5. However, since the event starts on 2025-12-05, the actual time difference is 89.58 days before 2025-12-06.\n\n6. To find the actual time in Enewetak Atoll when the event starts, we add the time difference to the starting time of the event in Enewetak Atoll:\n   08:30 (from the question) + 89.58 days * 24 hours/day = 89.58 days * 24 hours + 08:30 = 2130 hours + 08:30 = 2138:30\n\n7. To convert this time to Enewetak Atoll timezone (+1200 hours), we add 12 hours:\n   2138:30 + 12 = 2240:30 (Enewetak Atoll time)\n\nSo, the actual time in Enewetak Atoll when the event starts is 2240:30 on 2025-12-05.

However, the question asks for the time in Natuna Besar when the event starts at 2025-12-05 12:00 -0930, which is 2025-12-05 23:30 in the Marquesas Islands. To find the corresponding time in Natuna Besar, we add the time difference of +1630 hours to the event start time in the Marquesas Islands. So, 2025-12-05 23:30 +1630 = 2026-01-06 07:00 in Natuna Besar. However, the question asks for the actual time difference, not the time in Natuna Besar when the event starts. The actual time difference is not directly provided in the question, but it can be calculated as the difference between the times in Natuna Besar and the Marquesas Islands when the event starts, which is 07:00 - 12:00 = -5 hours. So, the actual time difference is -5 hours.)",

To find this, we first convert the Marquesas Islands time to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) by adding 9 hours and 30 minutes to get 2025-12-05 21:30 UTC. Then, we subtract the 1-hour difference between Zouar and UTC to get 2025-12-05 20:30 in Zouar.

Convert 2025-12-05 12:00 -0930 to UTC:\n   Add 9 hours and 30 minutes to 2025-12-05 12:00:\n   (9 hours = 9 * 60 minutes = 540 minutes)\n   (30 minutes = 30 minutes)\n   So, 2025-12-05 12:00 -0930 is equivalent to 2025-12-05 21:30 UTC.\n\n2. Convert 2025-12-06 04:30 +0800 to UTC:\n   No adjustment is needed since it's already in UTC+8.\n\nNow, let's find the time difference:\n\n- Subtract the earlier time (2025-12-05 21:30 UTC) from the later time (2025-12-06 04:30 UTC):\n  (2025-12-06 04:30 - 2025-12-05 21:30) = 7 hours and 0 minutes.\n\nSo, the event starts 7 hours after 2025-12-06 04:30 +0800 in Litang, Sichuan. To find the exact time, we add 7 hours to 2025-12-06 04:30 +0800:\n\n- Add 7 hours to 2025-12-06 04:30 +0800:\n  (7 hours = 7 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes)\n  (30 minutes = 30 minutes)\n  So, the event starts at 2025-12-06 11:30 +0800 in Litang, Sichuan.",

Let's do that:\n\nMarquesas Islands time (2025-12-05 12:00 -0930) = UTC-9:30 + 2025-12-05 12:00 = UTC-18:30 + 2025-12-05 12:00\n\nKonya time (2025-12-05 23:30 +0300) = UTC+3 + 2025-12-05 23:30 = UTC+3 + 2025-12-06 06:30 (since it's past midnight)\n\nNow, let's find the difference between these two times:\n\nUTC+3 + 2025-12-06 06:30 - (UTC-18:30 + 2025-12-05 12:00)\n\nFirst, let's find the common date: 2025-12-06. Then, subtract the times:\n\n6:30 + 18:30 - 12:00 = 24:30\n\nSince the hours part exceeds 24, we need to subtract 24 from it and add 1 to the days part:\n\n24:30 - 24 = 0:30 and 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the actual time difference is 2 days and 0:30 hours.\n\nNow, let's find the time in Konya when the event starts:\n\nSince the event starts at UTC-18:30, we need to subtract 3 hours (Konya's UTC+3 timezone) from that:\n\nUTC-18:30 - 3 = UTC-21:30\n\nTo convert UTC-21:30 to Konya time, we add 3 hours:\n\nUTC-21:30 + 3 = UTC-18:00 + 3 = UTC-15:00\n\nSince Konya is in the UTC+3 timezone, we need to add 3 more hours to get the local time:\n\nUTC-15:00 + 3 = UTC+00:00 + 3 = UTC+03:00\n\nFinally, let's convert UTC+03:00 to Konya time:\n\nUTC+03:00 = UTC+03:00 + 3 = UTC+06:00\n\nSince Konya is in the UTC+3 timezone, we need to subtract 3 hours to get the local time:\n\nUTC+06:00 - 3 = UTC+03:00\n\nSo, the actual time in Konya when the event starts is UTC+03:00, which is 2025-12-05 14:00 in Konya time.",

Let's do that:\n\n1. Convert 2025-12-06 08:30 -0930 to UTC:\n   - Add 9 hours to 08:30 (since -0930 is 9 hours behind UTC) to get 17:30 UTC.\n\n2. Convert 2025-12-07 01:00 +0800 to UTC:\n   - No adjustment is needed since +0800 is already 8 hours ahead of UTC.\n\nNow, let's compare the times:\n- 17:30 UTC is NOT 1 hour after 01:00 UTC.\n\nSo, the actual time difference is not 1 hour, and the event does not start 1 hour after 2025-12-07 01:00 +0800 in Makassar, Sulawesi.\n\nTo find the time in Makassar, Sulawesi when the event starts, we need to subtract 8 hours from the event's UTC time (since +0800 is 8 hours ahead of UTC):\n\n17:30 UTC - 8 hours = 09:30 UTC - 8 hours = 01:30 local time in Makassar, Sulawesi.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the time in Makassar, Sulawesi, we should convert this UTC time to the local time in Makassar, Sulawesi, which is +0800. To do that, we add 8 hours to the UTC time:\n\n01:30 UTC + 8 hours = 09:30 +0800.\n\nSo, the actual time in Makassar, Sulawesi when the event starts is 09:30 +0800.",

Let's do that:\n\n1. Convert 2025-12-06 08:30 -0930 Marquesas Islands time to UTC:\n   -9 hours = -9 hours (since Marquesas Islands is 9 hours behind UTC)\n   So, 2025-12-06 08:30 -0930 Marquesas Islands time is equivalent to 2025-12-06 17:30 UTC\n\n2. Convert 2025-12-07 01:00 +0800 to UTC:\n   +8 hours = +8 hours (since Perth, WA is 8 hours ahead of UTC)\n   So, 2025-12-07 01:00 +0800 is equivalent to 2025-12-06 17:00 UTC\n\nNow, let's find the time difference:\n\n2025-12-06 17:30 UTC - 2025-12-06 17:00 UTC = 30 minutes\n\nSo, the event starts 30 minutes after 2025-12-06 17:00 UTC, which is 2025-12-06 17:30 UTC.\n\nTo find the time in Halls Creek, WA (which is in the same timezone as Perth, WA), we just need to convert 2025-12-06 17:30 UTC to +0800:\n\n+8 hours = +8 hours (since Perth, WA is 8 hours ahead of UTC)\nSo, 2025-12-06 17:30 UTC is equivalent to 2025-12-07 01:30 +0800 in Halls Creek, WA.\n\nTherefore, the event starts at 2025-12-07 01:30 +0800 in Halls Creek, WA.",
