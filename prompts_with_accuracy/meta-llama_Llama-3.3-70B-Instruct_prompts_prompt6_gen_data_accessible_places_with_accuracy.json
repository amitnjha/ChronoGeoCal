Since April 4 is after the start of daylight saving time in 2024, New York is on UTC-4.\n\nManaus is in the Amazonas Time (AMT) zone, which is UTC-4 as well when New York is on daylight saving time, but does not observe daylight saving time itself. However, considering the time difference based on standard time zones without accounting for daylight saving adjustments, Manaus would be the same as New York during standard time. But since both are effectively at the same offset during the period of interest (April), we consider them to have the same time for simplicity in this context.\n\nEvent A ends at 2:01 PM New York time, and Event B must start at least 1 hour after. So, the earliest Event B can start is 3:01 PM New York time.\n\nGiven that Manaus and New York have the same time offset during this period for our purposes, the start time for Event B in Manaus would also be 3:01 PM local time.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the time in the Hebrew calendar, which doesn't change the fact that we're looking for a time of day but does imply we should consider the date. Since the date doesn't change from the start of Event A to the start of Event B, and we've established the time based on their respective time zones, the earliest possible start time for Event B in Manaus local time, in the context given, remains tied to the Gregorian date's conversion for time zone purposes.\n\nThus, the answer, focusing strictly on the time aspect as requested and considering the constraints provided, would be 3:01 PM on the same Hebrew date, but since the format demands a very specific type of answer which seems to be geared towards multiple-choice or true/false questions rather than a time, and given the constraints of the format which doesn't directly apply to this type of question, the response cannot be accurately provided in the requested format.
