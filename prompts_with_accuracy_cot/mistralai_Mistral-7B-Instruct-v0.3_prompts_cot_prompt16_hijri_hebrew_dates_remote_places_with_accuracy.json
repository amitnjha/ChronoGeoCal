Calculate the Hijri date (HJD) from the Julian date using the following formula:\n   HJD = JD - 621595 + 30 * (JD - 29) / 153\n\n3. Convert the Hijri Julian Day (HJD) to the Hijri date (YYYY-MM-DD) using the following steps:\n   a. Find the Hijri year (Y) by rounding down (⌊⌋) HJD to the nearest integer and subtracting 621595.\n   b. Calculate the Hijri month (M) by finding the remainder of HJD divided by 354 (the number of days in a Hijri year).\n   c. Calculate the Hijri day (D) by finding the remainder of the difference between HJD and the product of M and 354 divided by the Hijri month length (30).\n\n4. Convert the Hijri year (Y) to the Gregorian year (G) using the following formula:\n   G = Y - 622 HC + 21 JC + 395 AB + 97 BC + 15 CA + 3 AD\n   where HC, JC, AB, BC, CA, and AD are the Hijri, Julian, AH (Arabic), Gregorian, Julian, and AD (Anno Domini) eras, respectively.\n\n5. The Hijri year (Y) is 1440, so we can find the Hijri, Julian, AH, Gregorian, Julian, and AD eras as follows:\n   a. HC = Y - 1\n   b. JC = HC - 1592\n   c. AH = HC - 622\n   d. G = AH + 622\n   e.

Convert the Gregorian date (2025-03-10) to the Hijri date using a Hijri calendar converter.\n2. The Hijri date for March 10, 2025, is 1442-09-23 (Dhul-Qi'dah 23, 1442 AH).\n3. However, the Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar, and the month of Dhul-Qi'dah can have 29 or 30 days. Since the day of the month is 23, we need to check if it's a leap year (i.e., Dhul-Qi'dah has 30 days) in the Hijri calendar.\n4. To determine if it's a leap year, we need to find the number of whole years that have passed since the Hijra (the migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD). In this case, it's 1442 years.\n5. To check for a leap year, we use the following rule: If the number of whole years is divisible by 30 but not divisible by 120, then it's a leap year.\n6. In this case, 1442 is divisible by 30 (48 divisions with a remainder of 0), but it's not divisible by 120 (12 divisions with a remainder of 28).\n7. Since it's not a leap year, the correct Hijri date for March 10, 2025, is 1442-09-23 (Dhul-Qi'dah 23, 1442 AH).\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the current date in the Hijri calendar, the answer should be updated to the correct date for the current Gregorian date (which is not March 10, 2025, at the time of writing).

However, the Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar, and the month of Dhul-Qi'dah can have 29 or 30 days. To find the exact date, we need to know if the 27th of March corresponds to the 29th or 30th day of Dhul-Qi'dah in the Hijri calendar.\n4. To determine this, we can check the moon sighting reports for that specific date in 2025. If the moon was sighted on March 26, then the date in the Hijri calendar would be Dhul-Qi'dah 29, and the answer would be D. If the moon was sighted on March 27, then the date in the Hijri calendar would be Dhul-Qi'dah 30, and the answer would be E (since there is no E option, we can't provide an answer according to the given format).\n5.

Find the Gregorian date of the Islamic New Year (Muharram 1) for the year 2025. The Islamic New Year usually falls on or around July 9, but it can vary by a day or two depending on the sighting of the moon. For the year 2025, the Islamic New Year falls on July 7.\n\n2. Convert the Gregorian date to the Hijri date. The Hijri date is calculated by subtracting the number of days from the Islamic New Year to the given date (April 2, 2025) from the number of days in the month of Muharram in the year 2025 (29 or 30 days, depending on the sighting of the moon).\n\n3. Since the Islamic New Year is on July 7, 2025, and April 2, 2025, is 199 days later, we need to find the number of days in Muharram 2025 that are greater than or equal to 199.\n\n4. The number of days in Muharram is 30, but since it's a leap year, an extra day (29th Rabi' al-awwal) is added, making the total number of days in Muharram and Rabi' al-awwal 60 days.\n\n5. Subtracting the number of days from the Islamic New Year to April 2 (199 days) from the total number of days in Muharram and Rabi' al-awwal (60 days), we get 139 days.\n\n6. Since the Hijri calendar is lunar, the months have variable lengths, and the year 2025 is a leap year, the current date in the Hijri calendar is the 139th day of the year, which corresponds to the 13th day of Sha'ban (as the first 30 days of Muharram and the first 29 days of Rabi' al-awwal have passed).\n\nSo, the answer is D (13th day of Sha'ban).",

The visibility of the crescent moon after the new moon (conjunction) can vary depending on the location and weather conditions. As of now, there is no definitive answer to whether the crescent moon has been sighted on June 20, 2025, in the Hijri calendar.\n5. Therefore, the answer to the question \"What is the current date in the Hijri calendar?\" cannot be definitively answered without knowing the sighting of the crescent moon on June 20, 2025.\n\nSince the question asks for the current date, and we cannot definitively answer it without knowing the sighting of the crescent moon, the answer is INDEFINITE.",

Find the Gregorian date of the Islamic New Year (1 Muharram) for the year 2025. The Islamic New Year usually falls on July 9 or July 10 in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n2. Convert the Gregorian date to the Hijri date using a Hijri calendar converter. The Hijri date for July 9, 2025, is 1440 AH (After Hijra).\n\n3. Since the question asks for the date on July 6, 2025, we need to find the Hijri date for July 6, 2025. To do this, we subtract 3 days from the Hijri date of July 9, 2025, which gives us 1440 AH - 3 = 1439 AH.\n\n4. The answer is 1439 AH. However, since the question asks for the date in the Hijri calendar, we need to find the corresponding date within the month of Muharram. To do this, we need to know the number of days in the month of Muharram in the Hijri year 1439.\n\n5. The number of days in the month of Muharram in the Hijri year 1439 can be found using a Hijri calendar or by using the formula: 30 + (11 x (1439 mod 30)) = 30 + (11 x 29) = 359.\n\n6. Since July 6, 2025, is the 182nd day of the year, we need to find the day of the month within Muharram 1439 by adding the number of days from the start of the year (1st Muharram) to July 6, 2025, and then subtracting the number of days in the first 11 months of the year (330 days).\n\n7. The calculation is as follows: 182 - 330 + 359 = -148 + 359 = 211.\n\n8. Since the Hijri year starts in the Gregorian year, we need to subtract 1 from the month to get the correct Hijri month. So, 11 - 1 = 10.\n\n9. Finally, we can find the date in the Hijri calendar by adding the day number (211) to the starting day of the month (1) in the Hijri month (10). The answer is 10 Muharram 1439 AH.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a single-token answer, we cannot provide the full calculation. Instead, we will provide the final answer: 10M.

However, the Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar, and the month of Dhul-Qi'dah can start on different days of the week.

Convert the Gregorian date (2025-08-16) to the Hijri date using a Hijri calendar converter.\n2. The Hijri date for August 16, 2025, is 1443-09-14 (Dhul-Qi'dah 14, 1443 AH).\n3. However, the Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar, and the month of Dhul-Qi'dah can have 29 or 30 days. Since the day of the month is 14, we need to check if it's a leap year (i.e., if Dhul-Qi'dah has 30 days).\n4. To determine if it's a leap year, we need to know the number of whole years that have passed since the Hijri year 1 (622 AD). In this case, it's 1443 years.\n5. To check for a leap year, we use the formula: (11 x number of whole centuries) + (number of whole years remaining after the last century) + 11 mod 30.\n6. In this case, the calculation is (11 x 14) + (43) + 11 mod 30 = 168 + 43 + 11 = 222. Since 222 is not divisible by 30, it's not a leap year.\n7. Therefore, the Hijri date for August 16, 2025, is 1443-09-14 (Dhul-Qi'dah 14, 1443 AH). Since it's not a leap year, the month has 29 days.\n\nNow, let's find the answer to the question:\n\nWhat is the current date in the Hijri calendar?\n\nThe answer is: 1443-09-14 (Dhul-Qi'dah 14, 1443 AH).",

However, the Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar, and the months can sometimes have 29 or 30 days. To find the exact day number, we need to know the number of days in the month of Dhul-Qi'dah in that year.\n4. The number of days in Dhul-Qi'dah can be found using a Hijri calendar table or by calculating it based on the Islamic rules for the length of the month.\n5. Once we have the day number, we can write the Hijri date in the format: Year-Month-Day.\n6.

Find the Gregorian date of the Islamic New Year (1 Muharram) for the year 2025. The Islamic New Year usually falls on or around July 9 or July 10. For the year 2025, it falls on July 10.\n\n2. Convert the Gregorian date to the Hijri date. This is a complex process that involves a lunar calendar and requires specific algorithms or tables. For simplicity, let's use an online Hijri date converter. The Hijri date for July 10, 2025, is 1443-08-20 (August 20, 1443 AH).\n\n3. Since the question asks for the current date in the Hijri calendar, we need to find the date that is 5 days after August 20, 1443 AH. The date would be 1443-08-25.\n\n4. However, the Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar, and months can have 29 or 30 days. To find the exact date, we would need to check if the 25th of August, 1443 AH, is a 29-day or 30-day month. This information is not provided, so we can't determine the exact date with certainty.\n\n5. To provide a possible answer, let's assume that August 20, 1443 AH, is the start of a 30-day month. In this case, the date 5 days later would be 1443-08-25.\n\n6. However, if August 20, 1443 AH, is the start of a 29-day month, we would need to add an extra day to get the 30th day of the month. In this case, the date 5 days later would be 1443-08-30.\n\n7. Since we don't have enough information to determine whether August 20, 1443 AH, is the start of a 29-day or 30-day month, we can't provide a definitive answer.\n\n8. To answer the question, we would need to provide both possible dates: 1443-08-25 and 1443-08-30. However, since the question format requires a single answer, we can't provide both dates. Instead, we'll provide the first possible date: 1443-08-25.\n\n9. To summarize, the answer is 1443-08-25 (or possibly 1443-08-30, depending on the length of the month).",

        "response": "A (Answer is not straightforward and requires calculation. Here's a step-by-step guide to find the answer:\n\n1. Convert the Gregorian date (2026-02-06) to the Julian date (JD).\n   JD = 2459333.5 + (2026 - 1582) / 4 + (6 - 1) / 4 - (2026 - 1582) / 100 + (2026 - 1582) / 400 + (6 - 1) / 365.25\n   JD ≈ 2460000.5\n\n2. Convert the Julian date to the Hijri date using the Islamic lunar calendar's 33-year cycle.\n   Hijri year = 108 (the starting year of the cycle) + (JD - 622.195345) / 354.2422\n   Hijri year ≈ 1441\n\n3. Calculate the Hijri month and day.\n   Hijri month = (JD - 622.195345) mod 354.2422 / 29.53059\n   Hijri day = (JD - 622.195345) - (Hijri month * 29.53059)\n   Hijri month ≈ 1\n   Hijri day ≈ 28\n\n4. The Hijri date for 2026-02-06 is 1441-01-28.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the current date in the Hijri calendar, it's important to note that the Hijri calendar is lunar, and its months are about 11 days shorter than the solar year. Therefore, the Hijri date will change approximately every 30 solar days. As of 2026-02-06, the Hijri date is not 1441-01-28 but rather a few days later.\n\nTo find the exact current Hijri date, you would need to know the current Gregorian date and perform the calculations again. Since the question asks for the date on 2026-02-06, I provided the Hijri date for that specific date.\n\nIn summary, the answer to the question \"What is the current date in the Hijri calendar?\" is not straightforward and requires knowledge of the current Gregorian date to find the exact Hijri date. However, for the given date of 2026-02-06, the Hijri date is approximately 1441-01-28.",

This is a leap year, so the day number (ordinal date) is 61.\n\n2. Convert the day number to the Hijri calendar using the following formula:\n   - For the first 30 days of the month, add 11 to the day number.\n   - For the remaining days of the month, add 11 + (day number - 30) * 30 / 365.\n\n3. The Hijri month corresponding to March 2, 2026, is Sha'ban (the 8th month in the Hijri calendar).\n\n4. To find the day within the month, use the formula above and adjust for the month being the 8th month instead of the first.\n\n5. The adjusted formula is: 11 + (day number - 30) * 30 / 365 + 8 * 30 / 12.\n\n6. Plug in the day number (61) and solve for the day within the month.\n\n7.

Convert the Gregorian date (2026-03-06) to the Julian date (JD).\n   JD = 2459383.5 + (365 * (2026 - 1)) / 4 + (365 * (2026 - 1) / 100) / 4 + (275 * (2026 - 1) / 400) - 719465.5 + (0.002586 * (2026 - 1))^2\n   JD ≈ 2460000.5\n\n2. Calculate the Hijri date (HJD) using the following formula:\n   HJD = JD - 621595 + 30 * (JD - 2460000.5) / 10631.\n   HJD ≈ 983444.5\n\n3. Find the Hijri year (AH) by rounding down to the nearest integer:\n   AH = 983\n\n4. Calculate the Hijri month (MH) using the following formula:\n   MH = 1 + (HJD - 30 * (AH - 1)) / 354.25\n   MH ≈ 2.64\n   Since the Hijri months have a length of 29 or 30 days, the month is either Muharram or Safar. To determine the exact month, we need to check the Hijri calendar for the specific year.\n\n5. Check the Hijri calendar for the year 983 AH to find the exact month:\n   Muharram has 29 days, so if the date falls between 29 and 30, it's Muharram. If it falls between 1 and 28, it's Safar.\n   Since the calculated HJD (983444.5) is greater than 983 * 354.25 + 29 (which is approximately 983354.25), the date falls between Muharram 29 and 30, so the answer is Muharram.\n\n6. Finally, calculate the Hijri day (DH) by subtracting the number of days in the previous months from the HJD:\n   DH = HJD - (30 * (AH - 1) + (30 * (AH - 1) / 4) + (29 * (AH - 1) / 1000) + (29 * (AH - 1) / 4000))\n   DH ≈ 983444.5 - (30 * 982 + 30 * 982 / 4 + 29 * 982 / 1000 + 29 * 982 / 4000)\n   DH ≈ 983444.5 - 296667.6\n   DH ≈ 686766.9\n   Since the Hijri days have a length of 29 or 30, the day is either 29 or 30. To determine the exact day, we need to check the Hijri calendar for the specific year and month.\n\n7. Check the Hijri calendar for the year 983 AH and month Muharram to find the exact day:\n   The 6th of Muharram, 983 AH, falls on a Wednesday. Since the calculated HJD (686766.9) is greater than the HJD for the 5th of Muharram (686765.9), the date is the 6th of Muharram.\n\nSo, the answer is Muharram 6.",

Find the Gregorian date corresponding to the Hijri year 1440 (which started on July 11, 2009).\n2. Calculate the number of days elapsed since July 11, 2009, up to May 23, 2026.\n3. Convert the total number of days into Hijri days (354 or 355 days in a year, with an extra day in a lunar leap year).\n4. Add the number of Hijri years that have elapsed since 1440, considering that a Hijri year is approximately 354.36 days long.\n5. Round down the result to the nearest whole number to get the Hijri year.\n6. Subtract 1 from the rounded number to get the current Hijri year (since the Hijri year starts on Muharram 1).\n7. Find the day of the month in the Hijri calendar for May 23, 2026, by calculating the number of days elapsed since the start of the current Hijri year.\n8. The current date in the Hijri calendar is the Hijri year and the day of the month (e.g., 1445-05-xx).\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot perform these calculations directly.

After converting the date, the Hijri date for March 1, 2027, will be approximately 1340 AH (Anno Hegirae, the Islamic year).
