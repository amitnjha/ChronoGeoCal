Convert 2025-12-05 12:00 -0930 Marquesas Islands time to UTC:\n   -930 hours = -930 + 12 (since it's already past 12:00) = -918 hours\n   -918 hours = -918 mod 24 = -38 (since it's less than 0, we add 24 hours to get a positive number)\n   -38 hours = -38 + 12 (since it's already past 12:00) = -26 hours\n   So, 2025-12-05 12:00 -0930 Marquesas Islands time is equivalent to 2025-12-04 18:00 UTC.\n\n2. Convert 2025-12-06 03:30 +0700 in Khon Kaen to UTC:\n   +0700 hours = +0700 + 6 (since it's already past 03:30) = +0706 hours\n   +0706 hours = +0706 mod 24 = +19 (since it's greater than 0, no adjustments are needed)\n   So, 2025-12-06 03:30 +0700 in Khon Kaen is equivalent to 2025-12-06 14:36 UTC.\n\n3. Now, let's find the difference between the two times:\n   - 2025-12-04 18:00 UTC - 2025-12-06 14:36 UTC = -2 days, 0 hours, 36 minutes\n\n4. Since the event starts on 2025-12-05, we need to add one day to our result:\n   - 2 days, 0 hours, 36 minutes + 1 day = 3 days, 0 hours, 36 minutes\n\n5. Now, let's convert this time difference back to Khon Kaen timezone (+0700):\n   - 3 days, 0 hours, 36 minutes = 72 hours, 0 minutes, 36 minutes\n   - 72 hours = 72 + 7 (since it's already past 14:36) = 89 hours\n   - 89 hours = 89 mod 24 = 21 (since it's greater than 0, no adjustments are needed)\n   - 36 minutes = 36 minutes + 30 minutes (since it's already past 14:36) = 66 minutes\n\n6. Finally, let's find the actual time in Khon Kaen when the event starts:\n   - 2025-12-05 12:00 -0930 Marquesas Islands time + 3 days, 0 hours, 36 minutes (in UTC) + 89 hours, 66 minutes (in +0700) = 2025-12-08 03:36 in Khon Kaen.\n\nSo, the actual time in Khon Kaen when the event starts is 2025-12-08 03:36.",

So, we need to subtract 1 hour from the calculated time:\n\n2025-12-05 11:00 in Bismarck time - 1 hour = 2025-12-05 10:00 in Bismarck time.\n\nSo, the actual time when the event starts in Bismarck is 2025-12-05 10:00.

Convert the Marquesas Islands time to UTC:\n   -0930 hours is 9 hours behind UTC, so 2025-12-06 08:30 -0930 Marquesas Islands time is equivalent to 2025-12-06 17:30 UTC.\n\n2. Convert the Cuiaba time to UTC:\n   -0400 hours is 4 hours behind UTC, so 2025-12-06 13:00 -0400 Cuiaba time is equivalent to 2025-12-06 17:00 UTC.\n\n3. Now, compare the times:\n   The event in the Marquesas Islands starts at 2025-12-06 17:30 UTC, which is 30 minutes after the time in Cuiaba, 2025-12-06 17:00 UTC.\n\n4. To find the actual time in Cuiaba when the event starts, we subtract 30 minutes from the Cuiaba time:\n   2025-12-06 17:00 UTC - 30 minutes = 2025-12-06 16:30 UTC.\n\n5. Convert the UTC time back to Cuiaba timezone:\n   Cuiaba is 4 hours ahead of UTC, so 2025-12-06 16:30 UTC is equivalent to 2025-12-06 20:30 -0400 in Cuiaba.\n\nSo, the actual time difference is 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the event starts at 2025-12-06 20:30 -0400 in Cuiaba.",
